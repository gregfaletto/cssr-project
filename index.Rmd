# Introduction

Cluster stability selection is a feature selection method designed to allow stability selection to work effectively in the presence of highly correlated features.  It was proposed in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.00494):

```{r faletto2022}
#' Faletto, G., & Bien, J. (2022). Cluster Stability Selection.
#' \emph{arXiv preprint arXiv:2201.00494}.
#' \url{https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.00494}.
```

This bookdown uses [literate programming](https://jacobbien.github.io/litr-project/) to define the ``r params$package_name`` R package, which implements the procedures described in the paper.  For a light introduction demonstrating how to use ``r params$package_name``, please see the package's vignette [here]().

# Overview

## Background

### Complementary pairs stability selection {#cpss}

The following paper introduces complementary pairs subsampling:

```{r shah2013}
#' Shah, R. D., & Samworth, R. J.
#' (2013). Variable selection with error control: Another look at stability
#' selection. \emph{Journal of the Royal Statistical Society. Series B:
#' Statistical Methodology}, 75(1), 55–80.
#' \url{https://doi.org/10.1109/RITA.2014.2302071}.
```

Subsamples \(A_1, \ldots, A_B \subset [n]\) of size \(\lfloor n/2 \rfloor\) are drawn, as well as subsamples \( \overline{A}_b \subset [n] \) of the same size with \(A_b \cap \overline{A}_b = \emptyset\).  Our function `getSubsamps()` implements this subsampling.

Writing $\hat{S}^\lambda(A)$ for the selected features from applying a variable selection procedure with tuning parameter $\lambda$ on the data in a subset $A\subset[n]$, Shah and Samworth suggest computing the following:

$$
\hat{\Pi}_B^{\text{(SS)}}(j) = \frac{1}{2B} \sum_{b=1}^B \left[1\left\{j \in \hat{S}^\lambda \left( A_b \right)\right\} + 1\left\{j \in \hat{S}^\lambda (\overline{A}_b)\right\} \right].
$$

### Cluster stability selection

We compute the proportion of the time that a feature \(j \in [p]\) is selected for at least one \(\lambda \in \Lambda\):
$$
\hat{\Pi}_B(j) := \frac{1}{2B} \sum_{b=1}^B \left[ 1\left\{   j \in \bigcup_{\lambda \in \Lambda} \hat{S}^\lambda \left( A_b \right) \right\} + 1\left\{  j \in  \bigcup_{\lambda \in \Lambda} \hat{S}^\lambda (\overline{A}_b)\right\} \right].
$$

We also compute a similar quantity at the level of clusters: For every cluster $C_k$, we calculate the proportion of the time that at least one feature from \(C_k\) is selected for at least one \(\lambda \in \Lambda\):

$$
\hat{\Theta}_B(C_k) :=  \frac{1}{2B} \sum_{b=1}^B \left[  1 \left\{    C_k \cap \bigcup_{\lambda \in \Lambda} \hat{S}^{\lambda}\left(A_b \right) \neq \emptyset   \right\} +  1 \left\{   C_k \cap \bigcup_{\lambda \in \Lambda} \hat{S}^{\lambda}\left(\overline{A}_b \right) \neq \emptyset  \right\} \right].
$$

We then calculate *cluster representatives* \(\boldsymbol{X}_{\cdot C_k}^{\text{rep}}\) as weighted averages of the cluster members:

$$
\boldsymbol{X}_{\cdot C_k}^{\text{rep}}:=  \sum_{j \in C_k } w_{kj} \boldsymbol{X}_{\cdot j}.
$$
We allow for several choices of weights:

- **Weighted averaged cluster stability selection:**

$$
w_{kj} = \frac{\hat{\Pi}_B(j)}{\sum_{j' \in C_k} \hat{\Pi}_B(j')} \qquad \forall j \in C_k  .
$$

- **Simple averaged cluster stability selection:**  

$$
w_{kj} = \frac{1}{\left| C_k \right|}  \qquad \forall j \in C_k .
$$

- **Sparse cluster stability selection:** For each \(j \in C_k \), 

$$
w_{kj} = \left. 1 \left\{ j \in \underset{j' \in C_k}{\arg \max}  \left\{ \hat{\Pi}_B(j') \right\} \right\} \middle/ \left| \underset{j' \in C_k}{\arg \max}  \left\{ \hat{\Pi}_B(j')  \right\} \right| \right. .
$$

## Outline

We will define the functions in this package in steps.

* First we define [the workhorse function of the package](#css), `css()`. This function takes as inputs a data set ($X$, $y$), a feature selection method $\hat S^\lambda(\cdot)$, and clusters of features appearing in the data: $C_1,\ldots,C_K$. It calculates random subsamples of the data ($A_1,\ldots, A_B$ and $\bar A_1,\ldots, \bar A_B$) and gets selected sets of features on each subsample (i.e., $\hat S^\lambda(A_b)$ and $\hat S^\lambda(\bar A_b)$). It returns a $2B\times p$ matrix of indicator variables for whether each feature was selected on each subsample (one row for each subsample, one column for each feature). It returns a similar $2B\times K$ matrix of indicator variables for whether any feature from each cluster was selected on each subsample. This is the most computationally intensive step of cluster stability selection, so it is isolated within its own function that is designed to be run only once on a data set.
* Next we [define functions](#sel-and-pred) that take these indicator matrices and return useful output--for example, selected sets of features, or predictions on test data. These outputs depend on the selected features, which themselves depend on user-selected parameters (for example, the cutoff for selection proportions for selected clusters). 
* Next, we define [wrapper functions](#wrapper-functions) that compute all of the above in one step in a user-friendly way. (These functions are not recommended for large data sets or for "power users" who may want to call these functions multiple times on the same data set, because these wrapper functions make a new call to `css()` every time they are called, which is slow and computationally wasteful if the inputs to `css()` are not changed.)
* Finally, we define [some other useful functions](#other-useful), like functions that generate clustered data to use for simulations or testing, or select a tuning parameter for the lasso via cross-validation.


## Package setup

Before proceeding to the actual functionality of the package, we start by specifying the information needed in the DESCRIPTION file of the R package.

```{r package-setup, message=FALSE, results='hide'}
usethis::create_package(
  path = ".",
  fields = list(
    Package = params$package_name,
    Version = "0.1.1",
    Title = "Cluster Stability Selection",
    Description = "Implementation of Cluster Stability Selection (Faletto and Bien 2022).",
    `Authors@R` = c(person(
      given = "Gregory",
      family = "Faletto",
      email = "gregory.faletto@marshall.usc.edu",
      role = c("aut", "cre")
      ), person(
      given = "Jacob",
      family = "Bien",
      email = "jbien@usc.edu",
      role = c("aut")
      ))
  )
)
usethis::use_mit_license(copyright_holder = "F. Last")
```

We also define the package-level documentation that shows up when someone types `package?cssr` in the console:

```{package_doc}
#' Cluster Stability Selection
#'
#' DESCRIBE PACKAGE HERE AND PERHAPS POINT USER TO PKGDOWN WEBSITE ONCE 
#' IT EXISTS.
#' 
#' @docType package
#' @seealso \code{\link{css}}
```

# The core function: `css` {#css}

The main inputs that `css()` accepts are the following:

* a design matrix `X`
* a response `y`
* a selection method `fitfun` with specified tuning parameter `lambda`.  This specifies $\hat{S}^\lambda(A)$.  In particular:

```{r param-fitfun}
#' @param fitfun A function; the feature selection function used on each
#' subsample by cluster stability selection. This can be any feature selection
#' method; the only requirement is that it accepts the arguments (and only the
#' arguments) `X`, `y`, and `lambda` and returns an integer vector that is a 
#' subset of `1:p`. For example, `fitfun` could be best subset selection or 
#' forward stepwise selection or LARS and `lambda` could be the desired model 
#' size; or `fitfun` could be the elastic net and `lambda` could be a length-two
#' vector specifying lambda and alpha. Default is `cssLasso`, an implementation 
#' of lasso (relying on the R package `glmnet`), where `lambda` must be a 
#' positive numeric specifying the L1 penalty for the `lasso`.
```

and

```{r param-lambda}
#' @param lambda A tuning parameter or set of tuning parameters that may be used
#' by the feature selection method `fitfun`. In the default case when
#' `fitfun = cssLasso`, lambda should be a numeric: the penalty to use for each
#' lasso fit. (`css()` does not require lambda to be any particular object because
#' for a user-specified feature selection method `fitfun`, lambda can be an
#' arbitrary object. See the description of `fitfun` below.)
```

* a specification of which features belong together in highly correlated clusters. This specifies the clusters $C_1,\ldots, C_K$. In particular:

```{r param-clusters}
#' @param clusters A list of integer vectors; each vector should contain the 
#' indices of a cluster of features (a subset of `1:p`). (If there is only one
#' cluster, clusters can either be a list of length 1 or an integer vector.)
#' All of the provided clusters must be non-overlapping. Every feature not
#' appearing in any cluster will be assumed to be unclustered (that is, they
#' will be treated as if they are in a "cluster" containing only themselves). If
#' clusters is a list of length 0 (or a list only containing clusters of length
#' 1), then `css()` returns the same results as stability selection (so the
#' returned `feat_sel_mat` will be identical to `clus_sel_mat`). Names for the
#' clusters will be needed later; any clusters that are not given names in the
#' provided list will be given names automatically by `css()`. Default is 
#' `list()` (so no clusters are specified).
```

* and a specification of the type of subsamples.  For now we only consider the [complementary subsets sampling of Shah and Samworth](#cpss).  However, we have included an option for Meinshausen-Buhlmann sampling which we may add later:

```{r param-sampling_type}
#' @param sampling_type A character vector; either "SS" or "MB". For "MB",
#' all B subsamples are drawn randomly (as proposed by Meinshausen and Bühlmann
#' 2010). For "SS", in addition to these B subsamples, the B complementary pair
#' subsamples will be drawn as well (see Faletto and Bien 2022 or Shah and
#' Samworth 2013 for details). Default is "SS", and "MB" is not supported yet.
```

The number of subsamples is also up to the user:

```{r param-B}
#' @param B Integer or numeric; the number of subsamples. Note: For
#' `sampling_type=="MB"` the total number of subsamples will be `B`; for
#' `sampling_type="SS"` the number of subsamples will be `2*B`. Default is 100
#' for `sampling_type="MB"` and 50 for `sampling_type="SS"`.
```


In this section, we will build the function `css()` step-by-step.

* First, `css()` creates random subsamples of the data: $A_1,\ldots, A_B$ (and $\bar A_1,\ldots, \bar A_B$ for Shah-Samworth subsampling). This is implemented in the function `createSubsamples()`.

* Next, `css()` executes the specified feature selection method $\hat S^\lambda(\cdot)$ on each subsample. This generates a binary matrix, `feat_sel_mat`, with one row for each subsample and one column for each feature in `X`. In each row, the entry corresponding to each feature equals 1 if the feature was selected on that subsample and 0 otherwise. `feat_sel_mat` is one of the outputs of `css()`; it is used to calculate the selection proportions for individual features. This is implemented in the function `getSelMatrix()`.
* So far this is the same as the original stability selection procedure. Now we take into account the clusters. The function `getClusterSelMatrix()` takes in the formatted clusters as well as `feat_sel_mat` and generates the binary matrix `clus_sel_mat`, which contains selection indicators for each cluster. `clus_sel_mat` has the same number of rows as `feat_sel_mat` and one column for each cluster rather than one for each feature. This is used to calculate the cluster selection proportions.

The function `css()` is specified below. (There are some extra details that I omitted in the above description for brevity; you can read the full details below.)

```{r}
#' Cluster Stability Selection
#'
#' Executes cluster stability selection algorithm. Takes subsamples of data,
#' executes feature selection algorithm on each subsample, and returns matrices
#' of feature selection indicators as well as cluster selection indicators.
#'
#' @param X An n x p numeric matrix (preferably) or a data.frame (which will
#' be coerced internally to a matrix by the function model.matrix) containing
#' p >= 2 features/predictors.
#' @param y The response; can be anything that takes the form of an
#' n-dimensional vector, with the ith entry corresponding to the ith row of X.
#' Typically (and for default `fitfun = cssLasso`), `y` should be an n-dimensional
#' numeric vector.
<<param-lambda>>
<<param-clusters>>
<<param-fitfun>>
<<param-sampling_type>>
<<param-B>>
#' @param prop_feats_remove Numeric; if `prop_feats_remove` is greater than 0,
#' then on each subsample, each feature is randomly dropped from the design
#' matrix that is provided to `fitfun` with probability `prop_feats_remove`
#' (independently across features). That is, in a typical subsample,
#' `prop_feats_remove*p` features will be dropped (though this number will vary).
#' This is similar in spirit (but distinct from) extended stability selection
#' (Beinrucker et. al. 2016); see their paper for some of the benefits of
#' dropping features (besides increasing computational speed and decreasing
#' memory requirements). For `sampling_type="SS"`, the features dropped in
#' each complementary pair of subsamples are identical in order to ensure that
#' the theoretical guarantees of Faletto and Bien (2022) are retained within
#' each individual pair of subsamples. (Note that this feature is not
#' investigated either theoretically or in simulations by Faletto and Bien
#' 2022). Must be between 0 and 1. Default is 0.
#' @param train_inds Optional; an integer or numeric vector containing the
#' indices of observations in `X` and `y` to set aside for model training by the
#' function `getCssPreds()` after feature selection. (This will only work if `y` is
#' real-valued, because `getCssPreds()` using ordinary least squares regression to
#' generate predictions.) If `train_inds` is not provided, all of the observations
#' in the provided data set will be used for feature selection.
#' @param num_cores Optional; an integer. If using parallel processing, the
#' number of cores to use for parallel processing (`num_cores` will be supplied
#' internally as the `mc.cores` argument of `parallel::mclapply()`).
#' @return A list containing the following items:
#' \item{`feat_sel_mat`}{A `B` (or `2*B` for `sampling_type="SS"`) x `p` numeric (binary) matrix. `feat_sel_mat[i, j] = 1` if feature `j` was selected by the base feature selection method on subsample `i`, and 0 otherwise.}
#' \item{`clus_sel_mat`}{A `B` (or `2*B` for SS sampling) x `length(clusters)` numeric (binary) matrix. `clus_sel_mat[i, j] = 1` if at least one feature from cluster j was selected by the base feature selection method on subsample `i`, and 0 otherwise.}
#' \item{`X`}{The `X` matrix provided to `css()`, coerced from a data.frame to a 
#' matrix if needed.}
#' \item{`y`}{The `y` vector provided to `css()`.}
#' \item{`clusters`}{A named list of integer vectors containing all of the clusters provided to `css()`, as well as size 1 clusters of any features not listed in any
#' of the clusters provided to `css()`. All clusters will have names; any 
#' clusters not provided with a name in the input to `css()` will be given names
#' automatically by `css()` (of the form c1, etc.).}

Tests for `css()` and the other functions in this section are located at the end of this document. Next, we'll build the individual functions one at a time. (The one function above that I didn't mention at all is `checkCssInputs()`, which confirms that the inputs to `css()` are as expected and does some basic formatting on the inputs. To streamline presentation, this and other helper functions are specified later.)

## Main components of `css`

### Generating subsamples

The function `createSubsamples()` is responsible for generating the subsamples $A_b$, where $b$ ranges from 1 to $B$ or 1 to $2B$ depending on the type of subsampling:

```{r}
#' Creates lists of subsamples for stability selection.
#'
#' @param n Integer or numeric; sample size of the data set.
#' @param p Integer or numeric; number of features.
<<param-B>>
<<param-sampling_type>>
#' @param num_feats_remove Integer; number of features select automatically on
#' every iteration. Determined earlier from input prop_feats_remove to css.
#' @return A list of length `B` (or `2*B` for `sampling_type = "SS"`). If
#' `prop_feats_remove = 0`, each list element is an integer vector of length
#' `floor(n/2)` containing the indices of a subsample of `1:n`. (For
#' `sampling_type=="SS"`, the last `B` subsamples will be complementary pairs of
#' the first `B` subsamples; see Faletto and Bien 2022 or Shah and Samworth 2013
#' for details.) If `prop_feats_remove > 0`, each element is a named list with
#' members "subsample" (same as above) and "feats_to_keep", a logical vector
#' of length `p`; `feats_to_keep[j] = TRUE` if feature `j` is chosen for this
#' subsample, and false otherwise.

    if(prop_feats_remove == 0){
        subsamples <- getSubsamps(n, B, sampling_type)
        return(subsamples)
    } else{
        # In this case, we generate subsamples as well as logical vectors
        # of features to keep

                prob=1 - prop_feats_remove))
            # Make sure at least two entries are equal to TRUE (so that at
            # least two features are present for every subsample)--if not,
            # randomly choose features to add
            while(sum(feats_to_keep_i) < 2){
                false_inds <- which(!feats_to_keep_i)

                feats_to_keep=feats_to_keep_i)
        }

        if(sampling_type=="SS"){
            stopifnot(length(subsamples) == 2*B)
            for(i in 1:B){
                # Keep the same features as in the other subsample (this
                # ensures that the theoretical guarantee of Shah and Samworth
                # 2013 remains valid on every individual pair of subsamples)
                subsamps_and_feats[[B + i]] <- list(subsample=subsamples[[B + i]],
                    feats_to_keep=subsamps_and_feats[[i]]$feats_to_keep)
            }
        }

        # Check output
        stopifnot(all(names(subsamps_and_feats) == c("subsample",
            "feats_to_keep")))

        return(subsamps_and_feats)
    }
    # Shouldn't be possible to reach this part of function
    stop("createSubsamples failed to return anything")
}
```

Notice that `createSubsamples()` calls some helper functions to check the inputs (again, these are specified later in the helper functions section). `createSubsamples()` also calls the workhorse function `getSubsamps()` to generate a list of subsamples.

```{r}
#' Generate list of subsamples

#' will be complementary pairs of the first `B` subsamples (see Faletto and

### Forming selection matrices

The next function called in the body of `css()` is `getSelMatrix()`, which records for each feature $j$ and subsample $b$ whether $j\in \hat S^\lambda(A_b)$:

```{r}
#' Generates matrix of selection indicators from stability selection.
#'
#' @param x an n x p numeric matrix or a data.frame containing the predictors.
#' @param y A response vector; can be any response that takes the form of a
#' length n vector and is used (or not used) by fitfun. Typically (and for
#' default fitfun = cssLasso), y should be an n-dimensional numeric vector
#' containing the response.
<<param-lambda>>
<<param-B>>
<<param-sampling_type>>
#' @param subsamps_object A list of length `B` (or `2*B` if `sampling_type="SS"`),
#' where each element is one of the following: \item{subsample}{An integer
#' vector of size `n/2` containing the indices of the observations in the
#' subsample.} \item{drop_var_input}{A named list containing two elements: one
#' named "subsample", matching the previous description, and a logical vector
#' named "feats_to_keep" containing the indices of the features to be
#' automatically selected.} (The first object is the output of the function
#' createSubsamples when the provided prop_feats_remove is 0, the default, and
#' the second object is the output of createSubsamples when prop_feats_remove >
#' 0.)
#' @param num_cores Optional; an integer. If using parallel processing, the
#' number of cores to use for parallel processing (num_cores will be supplied
#' internally as the mc.cores argument of parallel::mclapply).
<<param-fitfun>>
#' @return A binary integer matrix of dimension `B` x `p` (if sampling_type ==
#' "MB") or `2*B` x `p` (if sampling_type == "SS"). res[i, j] = 1 if feature j

    return(res)
}
```

Again, `getSelMatrix()` uses some helper functions to check the inputs for safety. `getSelMatrix()` leverages the function `parallel::mclapply()` package, in order to allow for parallel processing if the user has set this up. This requires a helper function `cssLoop()`, which is also specified in the later section for helper functions. 
We add the `parallel` package to the DESCRIPTION file:

```{r}
usethis::use_package("parallel")
```

`getSelMatrix()` also uses a feature selection function `fitfun` as an input. `fitfun` can be provided by the user as an input to `css()`. We provide one default `fitfun`, `cssLasso()`, which works on a real-valued response y given a specified penalty parameter lambda > 0. Both for its own importance and to show an example of a valid `fitfun`, we show `cssLasso()` here.

```{r}
#' Provided fitfun implementing the lasso
#'
#' Function used to select features with the lasso on each subsample in cluster
#' stability selection. Uses glmnet implementation of the lasso.
#' @param X A design matrix containing the predictors. (In practice this will
#' be a subsample of the full design matrix provided to `css()`.)
#' @param y A numeric vector containing the response.
#' @param lambda Numeric; a nonnegative number for the lasso penalty to use
#' on each subsample. (For now, only one lambda value can be provided to
#' `cssLasso()`; in the future, we plan to allow for multiple lambda values to be
#' provided to `cssLasso()`, as described in Faletto and Bien 2022.)
#' @return An integer vector; the indices of the features selected by the lasso.

    if(is.null(pred[[1]])){return(integer())}

    stopifnot(!("try-error" %in% class(pred) | "error" %in% class(pred) |

    if(length(dim(pred)) == 2){
        selected_glmnet <- pred[, 1]
    } else if(length(dim(pred)) == 3){
        selected_glmnet <- pred[, 1, 1]
    } else if(length(dim(pred)) == 1){

    selected_glmnet <- as.integer(selected_glmnet)

    selected <- sort(selected_glmnet)

    return(selected)
}
```

Notice that `cssLasso()` depends on the package `glmnet`, and calls the function `checkCssLassoInputs()`, which verifies that the inputs to `cssLasso()` are as needed. (In particular, the function `css()` imposes very few requirements on `lambda` and `y` to allow the end user flexibility for any specified `fitfun`. `checkCssLassoInputs()` ensures that `y` is a real-valued response, `lambda` is a nonnegative real number, etc.) `checkCssLassoInputs()` is specified in the helper functions section later.

We add `glmnet` to the DESCRIPTION file as well:

```{r}
usethis::use_package("glmnet")
```



Finally, `getClusterSelMatrix()` is the last significant function called within `css()`.  It takes the information from `getSelMatrix()`, i.e. whether feature $j\in\hat S^\lambda(A_b)$, and outputs for every cluster $C$ whether $C\cap S^\lambda(A_b)\neq\emptyset$.

```{r}
#' Get cluster selection matrix
#'
#' Given a matrix of feature selection indicator variables and a list of
#' clusters of features, returns a matrix of cluster indicator variables.
#'
#' @param clusters A named list where each entry is an integer vector of indices
#' of features that are in a common cluster, as in the output of formatClusters.
#' (The length of list clusters is equal to the number of clusters.) All
#' identified clusters must be non-overlapping, and all features must appear in
#' exactly one cluster (any unclustered features should be in their own
#' "cluster" of size 1).
#' @param res A binary integer matrix. es[i, j] = 1 if feature j was selected
#' on subsample i and equals 0 otherwise, as in the output of `getSelMatrix()`.
#' (That is, each row is a selected set.)
#' @return A binary integer matrix with the same number of rows
#' as res and length(clusters) columns. Entry i, j is 1 if at least
#' one member of cluster j was selected on subsample i, and 0 otherwise.
#' @author Gregory Faletto, Jacob Bien
getClusterSelMatrix <- function(clusters, res){

    # Check input
    checkGetClusterSelMatrixInput(clusters, res)

    p <- ncol(res)

    n_clusters <- length(clusters)

    # Matrix of cluster selection proportions (with n_clusters columns)
    res_n_clusters <- matrix(rep(0L, nrow(res)*n_clusters), nrow=nrow(res),
        ncol=n_clusters)
    colnames(res_n_clusters) <- names(clusters)

    for(j in 1:n_clusters){
        # Identify rows of res where at least one feature from this cluster
        # was selected
        rows_j_sel <- apply(res, 1, function(x){any(x[clusters[[j]]] == 1)})

        # Put ones in these rows of res_n_clusters[, j]
        res_n_clusters[rows_j_sel, j] <- 1L

        if(length(clusters[[j]]) <= 1){
            next
        }
    }

    # Check output
    stopifnot(is.matrix(res_n_clusters))
    stopifnot(identical(colnames(res_n_clusters), names(clusters)))
    stopifnot(all(res_n_clusters %in% c(0, 1)))
    stopifnot(ncol(res_n_clusters) == length(clusters))

    return(res_n_clusters)
}
```

The helper function `checkGetClusterSelMatrixInput()` verifies the inputs to `getClusterSelMatrix()`.

With the above and the helper functions below, the `css()` function is complete!

## Helper functions

Below, we specify some of the helper functions for `css()`, which are less important for understanding what `css()` does.

* The function `checkCssInputs()` is called at the beginning of the `css()` function. It confirms that the inputs to `css()` are as expected. Also, `css()` allows some flexibility in how the inputs are formatted, and `checkCssInputs()` converts the inputs into consistent formats for later use.
  - The function `checkCssClustersInput()` is called within `checkCssInputs()`, and specifically checks the clusters input.
  - `formatClusters()` modifies clusters, ensuring every feature appears in exactly one cluster (any unclustered features are put in a "cluster" by themselves).
    * `checkFormatClustersInput()` verifies the input to `formatClusters()` for safety (this might seem a little redundant here, but `formatClusters()` is also called by different functions in this package).
      - `checkY()` ensures (here and elsewhere) that the provided `y` is as expected. (In particular, in general the inputted `y` can be a vector of any type as long as the specified `fitfun` can handle `y` appropriately. For some function inputs, `y` must be a numeric vector. `checkY()` enforces this, among other things.)
    * `checkClusters()` verifies that the output of `formatClusters()` is as expected.
    * `getPrototypes()` identifies the prototypes of each cluster--the feature within each cluster that has the largest marginal sample correlation with `y`.
      - `identifyPrototype()` is the workhorse of `getPrototypes()`, identifying the prototype given a single cluster.
        * `corFunction()` is a helper function called within `identifyPrototype()` to calculate the absolute value of the correlation between two vectors.
  - `checkSamplingType()` ensures that the input `sampling_type` is as expected. 
  - `checkB()` ensures that the input `B` is as expected.
  - `checkPropFeatsRemove()` ensures that the input `prop_feats_remove` is as expected.
* The function `cssLoop()` is called within `css()`. In particular, it is a helper function needed in order to allow for parallel processing of the feature selection method on each of the subsamples.
  - `checkCssLoopOutput()` verifies that the output of `cssLoop()` is as expected. This is particularly important because the user can specify their own feature selection method; `checkCssLoopOutput()` verifies that the output of the feature selection method is valid, and provides an informative error message if not.
* `checkCssLassoInputs()` checks that the inputs to the provided `fitfun`, `cssLasso()`, are as needed.
* `checkGetClusterSelMatrixInput()` verifies that the input to `getClusterSelMatrix()` is as expected.

Tests are written for all of these functions and appear as early as possible after the function is defined. (For functions that don't depend on any other functions, tests appear immediately after the function; for functions with dependencies, the tests appear after all dependencies have been defined.)

`checkCssInputs()`:

```{r}
#' Helper function to confirm that inputs to the function `css()` are as expected,
#' and modify inputs if needed
#'
#' @param X An n x p numeric matrix (preferably) or a data.frame (which will
#' be coerced internally to a matrix by the function model.matrix) containing
#' p >= 2 features/predictors.
#' @param y The response; can be anything that takes the form of an
#' n-dimensional vector, with the ith entry corresponding to the ith row of X.
#' Typically (and for default fitfun = cssLasso), y should be an n-dimensional
#' numeric vector.
<<param-lambda>>
<<param-clusters>>
#' @param fitfun A function; the feature selection function used on each
#' subsample by cluster stability selection. This can be any feature selection
#' method; the only requirement is that it accepts the arguments (and only the
#' arguments) X, y, and lambda and returns an integer vector that is a subset of
#' 1:p. For example, fitfun could be best subset selection or forward stepwise
#' selection or LARS and lambda could be the desired model size; or fitfun could be the
#' elastic net and lambda could be a length-two vector specifying lambda and
#' alpha. Default is cssLasso, an implementation of lasso (relying on the R
#' package glmnet), where lambda must be a positive numeric specifying the L1
#' penalty for the lasso.
#' @param sampling_type A character vector; either "SS" or "MB". For "MB",
#' all B subsamples are drawn randomly (as proposed by Meinshausen and Bühlmann
#' 2010). For "SS", in addition to these B subsamples, the B complementary pair
#' subsamples will be drawn as well (see Faletto and Bien 2022 or Shah and
#' Samworth 2013 for details). Default is "SS", and "MB" is not supported yet.
#' @param B Integer or numeric; the number of subsamples. Note: For
#' sampling.type=="MB" the total number of subsamples will be `B`; for
#' sampling_type="SS" the number of subsamples will be `2*B`. Default is 100
#' for sampling_type="MB" and 50 for sampling_type="SS".
#' @param prop_feats_remove Numeric; if prop_feats_remove is greater than 0,
#' then on each subsample, each feature is randomly dropped from the design
#' matrix that is provided to fitfun with probability prop_feats_remove
#' (independently across features). That is, in a typical subsample,
#' prop_feats_remove*p features will be dropped (though this number will vary).
#' This is similar in spirit (but distinct from) extended stability selection
#' (Beinrucker et. al. 2016); see their paper for some of the benefits of
#' dropping features (besides increasing computational speed and decreasing
#' memory requirements). For sampling_type="SS", the features dropped in
#' each complementary pair of subsamples are identical in order to ensure that
#' the theoretical guarantees of Faletto and Bien (2022) are retained within
#' each individual pair of subsamples. (Note that this feature is not
#' investigated either theoretically or in simulations by Faletto and Bien
#' 2022). Must be between 0 and 1. Default is 0.
#' @param train_inds Optional; an integer or numeric vector containing the
#' indices of observations in X and y to set aside for model training by the
#' function getCssPreds after feature selection. (This will only work if y is
#' real-valued, because getCssPreds using ordinary least squares regression to
#' generate predictions.) If train_inds is not provided, all of the observations
#' in the provided data set will be used for feature selection.
#' @param num_cores Optional; an integer. If using parallel processing, the
#' number of cores to use for parallel processing (num_cores will be supplied
#' internally as the mc.cores argument of parallel::mclapply).
#' @return A named list with the following elements: \item{feat_names}{A 
#' character vector containing the column names of X (if the provided X
#' had column names). If the provided X did not have column names, feat_names
#' will be NA.} \item{X}{The provided X, converted to a matrix if it was
#' originally provided as a data.frame, and with feature names removed if they
#' had been provided.}\item{clusters}{A list of integer vectors; each vector
#' will contain the indices of a cluster of features. Any duplicated clusters
#' provided in the input will be removed.}

#' ncol(x), if x is provided)
#' @param clust_names A character vector of the names of the clusters in
#' clusters.
#' @param get_prototypes Logical: if TRUE, will identify prototype from each
#' cluster (the feature from each cluster that is most correlated with the
#' response) for the protolasso. In this case, x and y must be provided.

#' (for example, a categorical response variable). However, y must be numeric in
#' order to provide prototypes because the prototypes are determined using the
#' correlation between cluster members (columns of x) and y.
#' @param R Numeric p x p matrix; not currently used. Entry ij contains the 
#' "substitutive value" of feature i for feature j (diagonal must consist of
#' ones, all entries must be between 0 and 1, and matrix must be symmetric)
#' @return A named list with the following elements: \item{clusters}{A named
#' list where each entry is an integer vector of indices of features that are in
#' a common cluster. (The length of list clusters is equal to the number of
#' clusters.) All identified clusters are non-overlapping. All features appear
#' in exactly one cluster (any unclustered features will be put in their own
#' "cluster" of size 1).} \item{multiple}{Logical; TRUE if there is more than
#' one cluster of size greater than 1, FALSE otherwise.} \item{prototypes}{only
#' returned if get_prototypes=TRUE. An integer vector whose length is equal to
#' the number of clusters. Entry i is the index of the feature belonging to

```{r}
#' Helper function run on each subsample
#' 
#' Runs provided feature selection method `fitfun` on each subsample for cluster
#' stability selection (this function is called within `mclapply`).
#' @param input Could be one of two things: \item{subsample}{An integer vector
#' of size `n/2` containing the indices of the observations in the subsample.}
#' \item{drop_var_input}{A named list containing two elements: one named
#' "subsample" and the same as the previous description, and a logical vector
#' named "feats_to_keep" containing the indices of the features to be
#' automatically selected.} (The first object is the output of the function
#' `createSubsamples()` when the provided `prop_feats_remove` is 0, the default, and
#' the second object is the output of `createSubsamples()` when `prop_feats_remove >
#' 0`.)
#' @param x an n x p numeric matrix containing the predictors. (This should be
#' the full design matrix provided to css.)
#' @param y A response; can be any response that takes the form of a length n
#' vector and is used (or not used) by `fitfun`. Typically (and for default
#' `fitfun = cssLasso`), `y` should be an n-dimensional numeric vector containing the
#' response. This should be the full response provided to css.
#' @param lambda A tuning parameter or set of tuning parameters that may be used
#' by the feature selection method. For example, in the default case when
#' `fitfun = cssLasso`, `lambda` is a numeric: the penalty to use for each lasso
#' fit.
#' @param fitfun A function that takes in arguments X, y, and lambda and returns
#' a vector of indices of the columns of X (selected features).
#' @return An integer vector; the indices of the features selected by `fitfun`.

# Selection and prediction functions {#sel-and-pred}

Now that `css()` has been defined and tested, we write functions to work with the output of `css()`. The output of these functions will be of more direct interest for most end users than the output of `css()`. These functions are defined separately from `css()` because the most computationally intensive steps happen within `css()`. `css()` can be called only once on a data set, and then the functions that follow can be explored relatively quickly (one can try different parameters, etc.).

* `getCssSelections()` takes in the results of `css()` along with user-defined parameters on how to select clusters (a minimum or maximum number of clusters to select, along with a cutoff for cluster selection proportions) and selects clusters as well as features from those clusters.
* `getCssDesign()` takes in the same inputs as `getCssSelections()` along with an unlabeled test matrix of features X (containing the same features as the X matrix provided originally to `css()`). It uses the results from `css()` to select clusters like `getCssSelections()`, then it uses a user-selected weighting scheme to compute weighted averages of the cluster members. It returns a test matrix of cluster representatives, which can be used for downstream predictive tasks.
* Finally, `getCssPreds()` has the same inputs as `getCssPreds()` *FIX THIS TYPO*, except it also accepts a set of labeled training data (where the response must be real-valued). `getCssPreds()` selects clusters, forms matrices of cluster representatives on the training and test data, uses the training matrix of cluster representatives (along with the vector of responses for the training data) to estimate a linear model via ordinary least squares, and finally generates predictions on the test data using this linear model.

As in the previous section, we first define each function and then define the helper functions called by that function. Tests are written for each function as soon as all of its dependencies have been defined.

* `getCssSelections()`
  - Calls `checkCutoff()`, which checks that the specified cutoff input is as expected
  - `checkWeighting()` verifies the weighting input to `getCssSelections()`
  - `checkMinNumClusts()` confirms that the `min_num_clusts` parameter provided to `getCssSelections()` is as expected
  - Likewise for `checkMaxNumClusts()`
  - `getSelectedClusters()` is the workhorse function of `getCssSelections()`, doing most of the work to get the selected clusters (and the selected features from those clusters) with the verified inputs
    * `checkSelectedClusters()` checks internally that the selected clusters are as expected
    * `getAllClustWeights()` gets the weights for each of the members of the selected clusters
      - `getClustWeights()` gets the weights for a single cluster
    * `checkGetSelectedClustersOutput()` verifies the output of `getSelectedClusters()`
* `getCssDesign()`
  - `checkNewXProvided()` confirms that the design matrix provided to `getCssDesign()` matches the characteristics of the matrix that was provided to `css()`. 
    * `checkXInputResults()` also verifies these inputs (and is also used by `getCssPreds()` on both the training and test data)
  - `formCssDesign()` is the workhorse function, generating a matrix of cluster representatives with the verified inputs to `getCssDesign()`
    * `checkFormCssDesignInputs()` verifies the inputs to `formCssDesign()` (somewhat redundantly here, but `formCssDesign()` is called by more than one function, so this verifies the inputs to `formCssDesign()` regardless of where it is called).
* `getCssPreds()`
  - `checkGetCssPredsInputs()` verifies the inputs to `getCssPreds()`

#' Helper function to check that output of getSelectedClusters is as expected
#'
#' @param selected_clusts A named numeric vector containing the selection

#' @param selected_feats A named integer vector; the indices of the features
#' with nonzero weights from all of the selected clusters.
#' @param weights A named list of the same length as the number of selected

```{r}
#' Obtain a design matrix of cluster representatives
#'
#' Takes a matrix of observations from the original feature space and returns
#' a matrix of representatives from the selected clusters based on the results
#' of cluster stability selection.
#' @param css_results An object of class "cssr" (the output of the function
#' css).
#' @param newX A numeric matrix (preferably) or a data.frame (which will
#' be coerced internally to a matrix by the function model.matrix) containing
#' the data that will be used to generate the design matrix of cluster
#' representatives. Must contain the same features (in the same
#' number of columns) as the X matrix provided to css, and if the columns of
#' newX are labeled, the names must match the variable names provided to css.
#' newX may be omitted if train_inds were provided to css to set aside
#' observations for model estimation. If this is the case, then when newX is
#' omitted getCssDesign will return a design matrix of cluster representatives
#' formed from the train_inds observations from the matrix X provided to css.
#' (If no train_inds were provided to css, newX must be provided to
#' getCssDesign.) Default is NA.
#' @param weighting Character; determines how to calculate the weights to
#' combine features from the selected clusters into weighted averages, called
#' cluster representatives. Must be one of "sparse", "weighted_avg", or
#' "simple_avg'. For "sparse", all the weight is put on the most frequently
#' selected individual cluster member (or divided equally among all the clusters
#' that are tied for the top selection proportion if there is a tie). For
#' "weighted_avg", the weight used for each cluster member is calculated in
#' proportion to the individual selection proportions of each feature. For
#' "simple_avg", each cluster member gets equal weight regardless of the
#' individual feature selection proportions (that is, the cluster representative
#' is just a simple average of all the cluster members). See Faletto and Bien
#' (2022) for details. Default is "weighted_avg".
#' @param cutoff Numeric; getCssDesign will only include those clusters with
#' selection proportions equal to at least cutoff. Must be between 0 and 1.
#' Default is 0 (in which case either all clusters are used, or max_num_clusts
#' are used, if max_num_clusts is specified).
#' @param min_num_clusts Integer or numeric; the minimum number of clusters to
#' use regardless of cutoff. (That is, if the chosen cutoff returns fewer than
#' min_num_clusts clusters, the cutoff will be increased until at least
#' min_num_clusts clusters are selected.) Default is 1.
#' @param max_num_clusts Integer or numeric; the maximum number of clusters to
#' use regardless of cutoff. (That is, if the chosen cutoff returns more than
#' max_num_clusts clusters, the cutoff will be decreased until at most
#' max_num_clusts clusters are selected.) Default is NA (in which case
#' max_num_clusts is ignored).
#' @return A design matrix with either nrow(newX) (or length(train_inds), if
#' train_inds was provided to css and newX was not provided to getCssDesign)
#' observations and number of columns equal to the number of selected clusters,
#' containing the cluster representatives for each cluster.

```{r}
#' Create design matrix of cluster representatives from matrix of raw features
#' using results of css function
#'
#' @param css_results An object of class "cssr" (the output of the function
#' css).
#' @param weighting Character; determines how to calculate the weights to
#' combine features from the selected clusters into weighted averages, called
#' cluster representatives. Must be one of "sparse", "weighted_avg", or
#' "simple_avg'. For "sparse", all the weight is put on the most frequently
#' selected individual cluster member (or divided equally among all the clusters
#' that are tied for the top selection proportion if there is a tie). For
#' "weighted_avg", the weight used for each cluster member is calculated in
#' proportion to the individual selection proportions of each feature. For
#' "simple_avg", each cluster member gets equal weight regardless of the
#' individual feature selection proportions (that is, the cluster representative
#' is just a simple average of all the cluster members). See Faletto and Bien
#' (2022) for details. Default is "weighted_avg".
#' @param cutoff Numeric; css will return only those clusters with selection
#' proportions equal to at least cutoff. Must be between 0 and 1. Default is 0
#' (in which case all clusters are returned in decreasing order of selection
#' proportion).
#' @param min_num_clusts Integer or numeric; the minimum number of clusters to
#' use regardless of cutoff. (That is, if the chosen cutoff returns fewer than
#' min_num_clusts clusters, the cutoff will be increased until at least
#' min_num_clusts clusters are selected.) Default is 1.
#' @param max_num_clusts Integer or numeric; the maximum number of clusters to
#' use regardless of cutoff. (That is, if the chosen cutoff returns more than
#' max_num_clusts clusters, the cutoff will be decreased until at most
#' max_num_clusts clusters are selected.) Default is NA (in which case
#' max_num_clusts is ignored).
#' @param newx A numeric matrix (preferably) or a data.frame (which will
#' be coerced internally to a matrix by the function model.matrix) containing
#' the data that will be used to generate the design matrix of cluster
#' representatives. Must contain the same features (in the same
#' number of columns) as the X matrix provided to css, and if the columns of
#' newx are labeled, the names must match the variable names provided to css.
#' newx may be omitted if train_inds were provided to css to set aside
#' observations for model estimation. If this is the case, then when newx is
#' omitted formCssDesign will return a design matrix of cluster representatives
#' formed from the train_inds observations from the matrix X provided to css.
#' (If no train_inds were provided to css, newX must be provided to
#' formCssDesign.) Default is NA.
#' @return A design matrix with the same number of rows as newx (or the 
#' train_inds provided to css) where the columns are the constructed cluster
#' representatives.

```{r}
#' Fit model and generate predictions from new data
#'
#' Generate predictions on test data using cluster stability-selected model.
#' @param css_results An object of class "cssr" (the output of the function
#' css).
#' @param testX A numeric matrix (preferably) or a data.frame (which will
#' be coerced internally to a matrix by the function model.matrix) containing
#' the data that will be used to generate predictions. Must contain the same
#' features (in the same number of columns) as the matrix provided to css, and
#' if the columns of testX are labeled, the names must match the variable names
#' provided to css.
#' @param weighting Character; determines how to calculate the weights to
#' combine features from the selected clusters into weighted averages, called
#' cluster representatives. Must be one of "sparse", "weighted_avg", or
#' "simple_avg'. For "sparse", all the weight is put on the most frequently
#' selected individual cluster member (or divided equally among all the clusters
#' that are tied for the top selection proportion if there is a tie). For
#' "weighted_avg", the weight used for each cluster member is calculated in
#' proportion to the individual selection proportions of each feature. For
#' "simple_avg", each cluster member gets equal weight regardless of the
#' individual feature selection proportions (that is, the cluster representative
#' is just a simple average of all the cluster members). See Faletto and Bien
#' (2022) for details. Default is "weighted_avg".
#' @param cutoff Numeric; getCssPreds will make use only of those clusters with
#' selection proportions equal to at least cutoff. Must be between 0 and 1.
#' Default is 0 (in which case either all clusters are used, or max_num_clusts
#' are used, if max_num_clusts is specified).
#' @param min_num_clusts Integer or numeric; the minimum number of clusters to
#' use regardless of cutoff. (That is, if the chosen cutoff returns fewer than
#' min_num_clusts clusters, the cutoff will be increased until at least
#' min_num_clusts clusters are selected.) Default is 1.
#' @param max_num_clusts Integer or numeric; the maximum number of clusters to
#' use regardless of cutoff. (That is, if the chosen cutoff returns more than
#' max_num_clusts clusters, the cutoff will be decreased until at most
#' max_num_clusts clusters are selected.) Default is NA (in which case
#' max_num_clusts is ignored).
#' @param trainX A numeric matrix (preferably) or a data.frame (which will
#' be coerced internally to a matrix by the function model.matrix) containing
#' the data that will be used to estimate the linear model from the selected
#' clusters. trainX is only necessary to provide if no train_inds were
#' designated in the css function call to set aside observations for model
#' estimation (though even if train_inds was provided, trainX and trianY will be
#' used for model estimation if they are both provided to getCssPreds). Must 
#' contain the same features (in the same number of columns) as the matrix 
#' provided to css, and if the columns of trainX are labeled, the names must
#' match the variable names provided to css. Default is NA (in which case
#' getCssPreds uses the observations from the train_inds that were provided to
#' css to estimate a linear model).
#' @param trainY The response corresponding to trainX. Must be a real-valued
#' response (unlike in the general css setup) because predictions will be
#' generated by an ordinary least squares model. Must have the same length as
#' the number of rows of trainX. Like trainX, only needs to be provided if no
#' observations were set aside for model estimation by the parameter train_inds
#' in the css function call. Default is NA (in which case getCssPreds uses the
#' observations from the train_inds that were provided to css).
#' @return A vector of predictions corresponding to the observations from testX.

`checkGetCssPredsInputs()`:

```{r}
#' Helper function to confirm that inputs to the function getCssPreds are as
#' expected, and modify inputs if needed.
#'
#' @param css_results An object of class "cssr" (the output of the function
#' css).
#' @param testX A numeric matrix (preferably) or a data.frame (which will
#' be coerced internally to a matrix by the function model.matrix) containing
#' the data that will be used to generate predictions. Must contain the same
#' features (in the same number of columns) as the matrix provided to css.
#' @param weighting Character; determines how to calculate the weights to
#' combine features from the selected clusters into weighted averages, called
#' cluster representatives. Must be one of "sparse", "weighted_avg", or
#' "simple_avg'. For "sparse", all the weight is put on the most frequently
#' selected individual cluster member (or divided equally among all the clusters
#' that are tied for the top selection proportion if there is a tie). For
#' "weighted_avg", the weight used for each cluster member is calculated in
#' proportion to the individual selection proportions of each feature. For
#' "simple_avg", each cluster member gets equal weight regardless of the
#' individual feature selection proportions (that is, the cluster representative
#' is just a simple average of all the cluster members). See Faletto and Bien
#' (2022) for details. Default is "weighted_avg".
#' @param cutoff Numeric; getCssPreds will make use only of those clusters with
#' selection proportions equal to at least cutoff. Must be between 0 and 1.
#' Default is 0 (in which case either all clusters are used, or max_num_clusts
#' are used, if max_num_clusts is specified).
#' @param min_num_clusts Integer or numeric; the minimum number of clusters to
#' use regardless of cutoff. (That is, if the chosen cutoff returns fewer than
#' min_num_clusts clusters, the cutoff will be increased until at least
#' min_num_clusts clusters are selected.) Default is 1.
#' @param max_num_clusts Integer or numeric; the maximum number of clusters to
#' use regardless of cutoff. (That is, if the chosen cutoff returns more than
#' max_num_clusts clusters, the cutoff will be decreased until at most
#' max_num_clusts clusters are selected.) Default is NA (in which case
#' max_num_clusts is ignored).
#' @param trainX A numeric matrix (preferably) or a data.frame (which will
#' be coerced internally to a matrix by the function model.matrix) containing
#' the data that will be used to estimate the linear model from the selected
#' clusters. trainX is only necessary to provide if no train_inds were
#' designated in the css function call to set aside observations for model
#' estimation (though even if train_inds was provided, trainX and trianY will be
#' used for model estimation if they are both provided to getCssPreds). Must 
#' contain the same features (in the same number of columns) as the matrix 
#' provided to css, and if the columns of trainX are labeled, the names must
#' match the variable names provided to css. Default is NA (in which case
#' getCssPreds uses the observations from the train_inds that were provided to
#' css to estimate a linear model).
#' @param trainY The response corresponding to trainX. Must be a real-valued
#' response (unlike in the general css setup) because predictions will be
#' generated by an ordinary least squares model. Must have the same length as
#' the number of rows of trainX. Like trainX, only needs to be provided if no
#' observations were set aside for model estimation by the parameter train_inds
#' in the css function call. Default is NA (in which case getCssPreds uses the
#' observations from the train_inds that were provided to css).
#' @return A named list with the following elements: \item{trainXProvided}{
#' Logical; indicates whether a valid trainX input was provided.} \item{trainX}{
#' The provided trainX matrix, coerced from a data.frame to a matrix if the
#' provided trainX was a data.frame. (If a valid trainX was not provided, this
#' output simply passes whatever was provided as trainX.)} \item{testX}{The
#' provided testX matrix, coerced from a data.frame to a matrix if the provided
#' testX was a data.frame.} \item{feat_names}{A character vector containing the
#' column names of testX (if the provided testX had column names). If the
#' provided testX did not have column names, feat_names will be NA.}
#' \item{max_num_clusts}{The provided max_num_clusts, coerced to an integer if
#' needed, and coerced to be less than or equal to the total number of clusters
#' from the output of css_results.}

# Other useful functions {#other-useful}

The following are some other functions that are useful for specific tasks.

* `genClusteredData()` generates jointly Gaussian data sets that include clusters of features that are correlated with a latent feature (the latent features themselves are also provided).
* `getLassoLambda()` uses a data set to choose a good value of lambda for subsamples of size n/2 (as in cluster stability selection) by cross-validation.
* `getModelSize()` estimates the best size for a lasso model on a provided data set.
* `printCssDf()` converts the output of the `css()` function (an object of class cssr) to a data.frame that is ready to be printed. We provide end-user access to `printCssDf()` because this data.frame itself may be useful as an object that summarizes the output from `css()`.
* `print.cssr()` is the print function for objects of class cssr.

* `genClusteredData()`
  - `checkGenClusteredDataInputs()` checks that the inputs to `genClusteredData()` are as expected.
  - `makeCovarianceMatrix()` generates a covariance matrix for a jointly Gaussian random variable with distribution matching the provided inputs.
  - `makeCoefficients()` generates a coefficient vector for the response according to the provided inputs.
  - Finally, `genMuXZSd()` draws a random Z (matrix of latent variables), X (observed matrix, containing, in general, features correlated with latent features, directly observed features that are associated with y, and noise features), conditional means mu, and observed responses y.
* `getLassoLambda()`
* `getModelSize()`
* `printCssDf()`
  - `getSelectionPrototypes()` identifies the prototypes from selected clusters (the feature in each cluster that is most correlated with the response)
* `print.cssr()`

`getLassoLambda()`:

```{r}
#' Get lambda value for lasso
#'
#' Chooses a lambda value for the lasso used on a subsample of size n/2 (as in
#' cluster stability selection) by cross-validation.
#' @param X An n x p numeric matrix (preferably) or a data.frame (which will
#' be coerced internally to a matrix by the function model.matrix) containing
#' the p >= 2 features/predictors that will be used by cluster stability
#' selection.
#' @param y The response; an n-dimensional numeric or integer vector. (Unlike
#' in the more general css setup, this response must be real-valued since
#' lambda will be determined using the lasso with cross-validation.)
#' @param lambda_choice Character; either "min" or "1se". If "min", chooses
#' the lambda that minimizes the cross-validated error; if "1se", chooses the
#' largest lambda within one standard error of the minimum error lambda
#' (resulting in a smaller selected set, which may be desirable because the
#' model size corresponding to the minimum error lambda tends to be larger
#' than optimal. See, for example, Bühlmann and Meinshausen 2006, Prop. 1 and
#' Bühlmann and van de Geer 2011, Section 2.5.1.). Default is "1se".
#' @param nfolds Numeric or integer; the number of folds for cross-validation.
#' Must be at least 4 (as specified by cv.glmnet). Default is 10.
#' @return A numeric; the selected value of lambda.

`getModelSize()`:

```{r}
#' Automated estimation of model size
#'
#' This function is uses the lasso with cross-validation to estimate the
#' model size. Before using the lasso, in each cluster all features will be
#' dropped from X except the one feature with the highest marginal correlation
#' with y, as in the protolasso (Reid and Tibshirani 2016).
#' 
#' @param X An n x p numeric matrix (preferably) or a data.frame (which will
#' be coerced internally to a matrix by the function model.matrix) containing
#' the p >= 2 features/predictors.
#' @param y A length-n numeric vector containing the responses; `y[i]` is the
#' response corresponding to observation `X[i, ]`. (Note that for the css
#' function, y does not have to be a numeric response, but for this function,
#' the underlying selection procedure is the lasso, so y must be a real-valued
#' response.)
#' @param clusters A named list where each entry is an integer vector of indices
#' of features that are in a common cluster, as in the output of css.
#' (The length of list clusters is equal to the number of clusters.) All
#' identified clusters must be non-overlapping, and all features must appear in
#' exactly one cluster (any unclustered features should be in their own
#' "cluster" of size 1).
#' @return An integer; the estimated size of the model. The minimum returned
#' value is 1, even if the lasso with cross-validation chose no features.

# Convenient wrapper functions {#wrapper-functions}

Finally, we provide convenient wrapper functions which yield user-desired output in a single step at the price of flexibility and efficiency. `cssSelect()` yields a selected set of clusters and features (the same output as `getCssSelections()`) in a single function call. `cssPredict()` takes in a training/selection data set as well as a test X. It uses the labeled data to select a set of features and train an OLS model on the selected features, and then it generates predictions on the test set using the fitted model.

Besides requiring only a single function call to yield desired output, these wrapper functions also automatically select hyperparameters (lambda used for the lasso, a desired model size, and even selection and training splits for `cssPredict()`) in a sensible way if these values are not provided by the user. So these functions are very convenient for an end user who wants quick results without getting "under the hood."

The two main disadvantages of these functions are flexibility and computational efficiency. For simplicity of use, these functions do not provide as many options as the component functions they call (for example, `min_num_clusts` is not an available argument for these models). Further, both of these functions make (computationally intensive) calls to `css()` internally every time they are called, so these functions are not recommended for users who want to tinker with the model size and other parameters. Instead, it would be more efficient to call css once and then work with the output as desired using the other package functions, which are very efficient given the stored output from `css()`.

`cssSelect()` and `cssPredict()` have no new dependencies; they rely only on already-defined functions.

`cssSelect()`:

```{r}
#' Obtain a selected set of clusters and features using cluster stability
#' selection
#'
#' Takes in data X and y and returns a set of clusters (and a set of features)
#' that are useful for predicting y from the data in X. This is a wrapper
#' function for css and getCssSelections. Using cssSelect is simpler, but it
#' has fewer options, and it executes the full (computationally expensive)
#' subsampling procedured every time it is called. In contrast, css can be
#' called just once, and then getCssSelections can quickly return results using
#' different values of cutoff, max_num_clusts, etc. from the calculations done
#' in one call to css.
#' @param X An n x p numeric matrix (preferably) or a data.frame (which will
#' be coerced internally to a matrix by the function model.matrix) containing
#' the p >= 2 features/predictors.
#' @param y A length-n numeric vector containing the responses; `y[i]` is the
#' response corresponding to observation `X[i, ]`. (Note that for the css
#' function, y does not have to be a numeric response, but for this function,
#' the underlying selection procedure is the lasso, so y must be a real-valued
#' response.)
#' @param clusters Optional; either an integer vector of a list of integer
#' vectors; each vector should contain the indices of a cluster of features (a
#' subset of 1:p). (If there is only one cluster, clusters can either be a list
#' of length 1 or an integer vector.) All of the provided clusters must be
#' non-overlapping. Every feature not appearing in any cluster will be assumed
#' to be unclustered (that is, they  will be treated as if they are in a
#' "cluster" containing only themselves). If clusters is a list of length 0 (or
#' a list only containing clusters of length 1), then css() returns the same
#' results as stability selection (so feat_sel_mat will be identical to
#' clus_sel_mat). Names for the clusters will be needed later; any clusters that
#' are not given names in the list clusters will be given names automatically by
#' css. Default is list() (so no clusters are specified, and every feature is
#' assumed to be in a "cluster" containng only itself).
#' @param lambda Optional; the tuning parameter to be used by the lasso for
#' feature selection in each subsample. If lambda is not provided, cssSelect
#' will choose one automatically by cross-validation. Default is NA.
#' @param cutoff Numeric; cssSelect will only select those clusters with
#' selection proportions equal to at least cutoff. Must be between 0 and 1.
#' Default is NA (in which case max_num_clusts are used).
#' @param max_num_clusts Integer or numeric; the maximum number of clusters to
#' use regardless of cutoff. (That is, if the chosen cutoff returns more than
#' max_num_clusts clusters, the cutoff will be decreased until at most
#' max_num_clusts clusters are selected.) Default is NA (in which case
#' either cutoff is used to choose the number of clusters, or if cutoff was also
#' unspecified, cssSelect chooses max_num_clusts by cross-validation).
#' @param auto_select_size Logical; if TRUE, then max_num_clusts will be
#' automatically estimated using the lasso with cross-validation. Default is
#' TRUE, though his argument is ignored if either cutoff or max_num_clusts is
#' provided. (If desired output is to return all clusters, you should set
#' auto_select_size to FALSE and do not provide cutoff or max_num_clusts.)
#' @return A named list with two items. \item{selected_clusts}{A list of
#' integer vectors; each vector contains the indices of one of the selected
#' clusters.} \item{selected_feats}{An integer vector; the indices of the
#' all of the selected features within all of the selected clusters (typically
#' only one feature is selected from each cluster).}

`cssPredict()`:

```{r}
#' Wrapper function to generate predictions from cluster stability selected
#' model in one step
#'
#' Select clusters using cluster stability selection, form cluster
#' representatives, fit a linear model, and generate predictions from a matrix
#' of unlabeled data. This is a wrapper function for css and getCssPreds. Using
#' cssPredict is simpler, but it has fewer options, and it executes the full
#' (computationally expensive) subsampling procedured every time it is called.
#' In contrast, css can be called just once, and then cssPredict can quickly
#' return results for different matrices of new data or using different values
#' of cutoff, max_num_clusts, etc. by using the calculations done in one call to
#' css.
#'
#' @param X_train_selec An n x p numeric matrix (preferably) or a data.frame
#' (which will be coerced internally to a matrix by the function model.matrix)
#' containing the p >= 2 features/predictors. The data from X_train_selec and
#' y_train_selec will be split into two parts; half of the data will be used for
#' feature selection by cluster stability selection, and half will be used for
#' estimating a linear model on the selected cluster representatives.
#' @param y_train_selec A length-n numeric vector containing the responses;
#' `y[i]` is the response corresponding to observation `X[i, ]`. Unlke the more
#' general setup of css, y_train_selec must be real-valued because predictions
#' will be generated by ordinary least squares.
#' @param X_test A numeric matrix (preferably) or a data.frame (which will
#' be coerced internally to a matrix by the function model.matrix) containing
#' the data that will be used to generate predictions. Must contain the same
#' features (in the same number of columns) as X_train_selec, and if the columns
#' of X_test are named, they must match the names of X_train_selec.
#' @param clusters Optional; either an integer vector of a list of integer
#' vectors; each vector should contain the indices of a cluster of features (a
#' subset of 1:p). (If there is only one cluster, clusters can either be a list
#' of length 1 or an integer vector.) All of the provided clusters must be
#' non-overlapping. Every feature not appearing in any cluster will be assumed
#' to be unclustered (that is, they  will be treated as if they are in a
#' "cluster" containing only themselves). If clusters is a list of length 0 (or
#' a list only containing clusters of length 1), then css() returns the same
#' results as stability selection (so feat_sel_mat will be identical to
#' clus_sel_mat). Names for the clusters will be needed later; any clusters that
#' are not given names in the list clusters will be given names automatically by
#' css. Default is list() (so no clusters are specified, and every feature is
#' assumed to be in a "cluster" containng only itself).
#' @param lambda Optional; the tuning parameter to be used by the lasso for
#' feature selection in each subsample. If lambda is not provided, cssPredict
#' will choose one automatically by cross-validation. Default is NA.
#' @param cutoff Numeric; getCssPreds will make use only of those clusters with
#' selection proportions equal to at least cutoff. Must be between 0 and 1.
#' Default is 0 (in which case either all clusters are used, or max_num_clusts
#' are used, if max_num_clusts is specified).
#' @param max_num_clusts Integer or numeric; the maximum number of clusters to
#' use regardless of cutoff. (That is, if the chosen cutoff returns more than
#' max_num_clusts clusters, the cutoff will be decreased until at most
#' max_num_clusts clusters are selected.) Default is NA (in which case
#' max_num_clusts is ignored).
#' @param train_inds Optional; an integer or numeric vector containing the
#' indices of observations in X and y to set aside for model training after
#' feature selection. If train_inds is not provided, half of the data will be
#' used for feature selection and half for model estimation (chosen at random).
#' @param auto_select_size Logical; if TRUE, then max_num_clusts will be
#' automatically estimated using the lasso with cross-validation. Default is
#' TRUE, though his argument is ignored if either cutoff or max_num_clusts is
#' provided. (If desired output is to generate predictions using all clusters,
#' you should set auto_select_size to FALSE and do not provide cutoff or
#' max_num_clusts.)
#' @return A numeric vector of length nrow(X_test) of predictions
#' corresponding to the observations from X_test.

# Competitor Methods

We also provide implementations of some competitor feature selection methods. We used these in the simulation studies in our paper to compare cluster stability selection to the protolasso (Redi and Tibshirani, 2016) and the cluster representative lasso (Bühlmann et. al. 2013), two other feature selection methods that are designed for data with clustered features. These feature selection methods are in some ways closely related, so their implementations share helper functions.

* `protolasso()`
  - `processClusterLassoInputs()` checks and formats the function inputs
  - `getXglmnet()` formats the provided design matrix `Xglmnet` for the lasso as implemented by `glmnet` (for the protolasso, this means discarding all features from each cluster except the one most highly correlated with the response; for the cluster representative lasso, this means replacing the clustered features with a simple average of the cluster members).
    * `checkGetXglmnetInputs()` verifies the inputs to `getXglmnet()`
  - Finally, `getClusterSelsFromGlmnet()` extracts the relevant output from the results yielded by a `glmnet` lasso fit.
    * `getSelectedSets()` takes in a single selected set from `Xglmnet` and yields a selected feature set in the original feature space (with each selected cluster from `Xglmnet` replaced by its prototype) as well as a selected set of clusters.
* `clusterRepLasso()`

`protolasso()`:

```{r}
#' Select features via the protolasso (Reid and Tibshirani 2016)
#'
#' @param X An n x p numeric matrix (preferably) or a data.frame (which will
#' be coerced internally to a matrix by the function model.matrix) containing
#' p >= 2 features/predictors
#' @param y The response; A length n numeric (or integer) real-valued vector.
#' @param clusters A list of integer vectors; each vector should contain the 
#' indices of a cluster of features (a subset of 1:p). (If there is only one
#' cluster, clusters can either be a list of length 1 or an integer vector.)
#' All of the provided clusters must be non-overlapping. Every feature not
#' appearing in any cluster will be assumed to be unclustered (that is, they
#' will be treated as if they are in a "cluster" containing only themselves).
#' Default is list() (so no clusters are specified).
#' @param nlambda Integer; the number of lambda values to use in the lasso fit
#' for the protolasso. Default is 100 (following the default for glmnet). For
#' now, nlambda must be at least 2 (using a single lambda is not supported).
#' @return A list with three elements. \item{selected_sets}{A list of integer
#' vectors. Entry k of this list contains a selected set (an integer vector) of
#' size k yielded by the protolasso (If no set of size k was selected, entry k
#' will be empty.)} \item{selected_clusts_list}{A list; each element of the list
#' is a named list of selected clusters. (That is, if a selected set of size k
#' was yielded by the protolasso, then selected_clusts_list[[k]] is a named
#' list of length k, where each member of the list is an integer vector
#' of cluster members. In particular, selected_clusts_lists[[k]][[j]] will be
#' the cluster that contains feature selected_sets[[k]][j].)} \item{beta}{The
#' beta output from glmnet when the lasso was estimated on a matrix of
#' prototypes. (See documentation for the function glmnet from the glmnet
#' package for details.)}

```{r}
#' Select features via the cluster representative lasso (Bühlmann et. al. 2013)
#'
#' @param X An n x p numeric matrix (preferably) or a data.frame (which will
#' be coerced internally to a matrix by the function model.matrix) containing
#' p >= 2 features/predictors
#' @param y The response; A length n numeric (or integer) real-valued vector.
#' @param clusters A list of integer vectors; each vector should contain the 
#' indices of a cluster of features (a subset of 1:p). (If there is only one
#' cluster, clusters can either be a list of length 1 or an integer vector.)
#' All of the provided clusters must be non-overlapping. Every feature not
#' appearing in any cluster will be assumed to be unclustered (that is, they
#' will be treated as if they are in a "cluster" containing only themselves).
#' Default is list() (so no clusters are specified).
#' @param nlambda Integer; the number of lambda values to use in the lasso fit
#' for the cluster representative lasso. Default is 100 (following the default
#' for glmnet). For now, nlambda must be at least 2 (using a single lambda is
#' not supported).
#' @return A list with three elements. \item{selected_sets}{A list of integer
#' vectors. Entry k of this list contains a selected set (an integer vector) of
#' size k yielded by the lasso--each member of the set is the index of a single
#' feature from a cluster selected by the cluster representative lasso (the
#' prototype from that cluster--the cluster member most highly correlated with
#' y). (If no set of size k was selected, entry k will be empty.)}
#' \item{selected_clusts_list}{A list; each element of the list is a named list
#' of selected clusters. (That is, if a selected set of size k was yielded by
#' the cluster representative lasso, then selected_clusts_list[[k]] is a named
#' list of length k, where each member of the list is an integer vector
#' of cluster members. Note that selected_clusts_lists[[k]][[j]] will be the
#' cluster that contains feature selected_sets[[k]][j].)} \item{beta}{The beta
