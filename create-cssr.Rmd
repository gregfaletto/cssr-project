## Package setup

We start by specifying the information needed in the DESCRIPTION file of the R package.

```{r package-setup, message=FALSE, results='hide'}
usethis::create_package(
  path = ".",
  fields = list(
    Package = params$package_name,
    Version = "0.0.0.9000",
    Title = "Cluster Stability Selection",
    Description = "Implementation of Cluster Stability Selection (Faletto and Bien 2022).",
    `Authors@R` = c(person(
      given = "Gregory",
      family = "Faletto",
      email = "gregory.faletto@marshall.usc.edu",
      role = c("aut", "cre")
      ), person(
      given = "Jacob",
      family = "Bien",
      email = "jbien@usc.edu",
      role = c("aut")
      ))
  )
)
usethis::use_mit_license(copyright_holder = "F. Last")
```

## Now to the package itself

Cluster stability selection is a feature selection method designed to allow stability selection to work effectively in the presence of highly correlated features. We will define the functions in this package in steps.

* First we define the workhorse function of the package, css. This function takes as inputs a data set, a feature selection method, and clusters of features appearing in the data. It calculates random subsamples of the data and gets selected sets of features on each subsample. It returns a matrix of indicator variables for whether each feature was selected on each subsample (one row for each subsample, one column for each feature). It returns a similar matrix of indicator variables for whether any feature from each cluster was selected on each subsample. This is the most computationally intensive step of cluster stability selection, so it is isolated within its own function that is designed to be run only once on a data set.
* Next we define functions that take these indicator matrices and return useful output--for example, selected sets of features, or predictions on test data. These outputs depend on the selected features, which themselves depend on user-selected parameters (for example, the cutoff for selection proportions for selected clusters). 
* Next, we define wrapper functions that compute all of the above in one step in a user-friendly way. (These functions are not recommended for large data sets or for "power users" who may want to call these functions multiple times on the same data set, because these wrapper functions make a new call to css every time they are called, which is slow and computationally wasteful if the inputs to css are not changed.)
* Finally, we define some other useful functions, like functions that generate clustered data to use for simulations or testing, or select a tuning parameter for the lasso via cross-validation.

### The core function: css

css accepts as an input a design matrix X, a response y, a selection method fitfun with specified tuning parameter lambda, and a specification of which features belong together in highly correlated clusters. In this section, we will build the function css step-by-step.

* First, css creates random subsamples of the data. This is implemented in the function createSubsamples.
* Next, css executes the specified feature selection method on each subsample. This generates a binary matrix, feat_sel_mat, with one row for each subsample and one column for each feature in X. In each row, the entry corresponding to each feature equals 1 if the feature was selected on that subsample and 0 otherwise. feat_sel_mat is one of the outputs of css; it is used to calculate the selection proportions for individual features. This is implemented in the function getSelMatrix.
* So far this is the same as the original stability selection procedure. Now we take into account the clusters. The function getClusterSelMatrix takes in the formatted clusters as well as feat_sel_mat and generates the binary matrix clus_sel_mat, which contains selection indicators for each cluster. clus_sel_mat has the same number of rows as feat_sel_mat and one column for each cluster rather than one for each feature. This is used to calculate the cluster selection proportions.

The function css is specified below. (There are some extra details that I omitted in the above description for brevity; you can read the full details below.)

```{r}
#' Cluster Stability Selection
#'
#' Executes cluster stability selection algorithm. Takes subsamples of data,
#' executes feature selection algorithm on each subsample, and returns matrices
#' of feature selection indicators as well as cluster selection indicators.
#'
#' @param X An n x p numeric matrix (preferably) or a data.frame (which will
#' be coerced internally to a matrix by the function model.matrix) containing
#' p >= 2 features/predictors.
#' @param y The response; can be anything that takes the form of an
#' n-dimensional vector, with the ith entry corresponding to the ith row of X.
#' Typically (and for default fitfun = cssLasso), y should be an n-dimensional
#' numeric vector.
#' @param lambda A tuning parameter or set of tuning parameters that may be used
#' by the feature selection method fitfun. In the default case when
#' fitfun = cssLasso, lambda should be a numeric: the penalty to use for each
#' lasso fit. (css does not require lambda to be any particular object because
#' for a user-specified feature selection method fitfun, lambda can be an
#' arbitrary object. See the description of fitfun below.)
#' @param clusters A list of integer vectors; each vector should contain the 
#' indices of a cluster of features (a subset of 1:p). (If there is only one
#' cluster, clusters can either be a list of length 1 or an integer vector.)
#' All of the provided clusters must be non-overlapping. Every feature not
#' appearing in any cluster will be assumed to be unclustered (that is, they
#' will be treated as if they are in a "cluster" containing only themselves). If
#' clusters is a list of length 0 (or a list only containing clusters of length
#' 1), then css() returns the same results as stability selection (so the
#' returned feat_sel_mat will be identical to clus_sel_mat). Names for the
#' clusters will be needed later; any clusters that are not given names in the
#' provided list will be given names automatically by css. Default is list() (so
#' no clusters are specified).
#' @param fitfun A function; the feature selection function used on each
#' subsample by cluster stability selection. This can be any feature selection
#' method; the only requirement is that it accepts the arguments (and only the
#' arguments) X, y, and lambda and returns an integer vector that is a subset of
#' 1:p. For example, fitfun could be best subset selection or forward stepwise
#' selection or LARS and lambda could be the desired model size; or fitfun could be the
#' elastic net and lambda could be a length-two vector specifying lambda and
#' alpha. Default is cssLasso, an implementation of lasso (relying on the R
#' package glmnet), where lambda must be a positive numeric specifying the L1
#' penalty for the lasso.
#' @param sampling_type A character vector; either "SS" or "MB". For "MB",
#' all B subsamples are drawn randomly (as proposed by Meinshausen and Bühlmann
#' 2010). For "SS", in addition to these B subsamples, the B complementary pair
#' subsamples will be drawn as well (see Faletto and Bien 2022 or Shah and
#' Samworth 2013 for details). Default is "SS", and "MB" is not supported yet.
#' @param B Integer or numeric; the number of subsamples. Note: For
#' sampling.type=="MB" the total number of subsamples will be `B`; for
#' sampling_type="SS" the number of subsamples will be `2*B`. Default is 100
#' for sampling_type="MB" and 50 for sampling_type="SS".
#' @param prop_feats_remove Numeric; if prop_feats_remove is greater than 0,
#' then on each subsample, each feature is randomly dropped from the design
#' matrix that is provided to fitfun with probability prop_feats_remove
#' (independently across features). That is, in a typical subsample,
#' prop_feats_remove*p features will be dropped (though this number will vary).
#' This is similar in spirit (but distinct from) extended stability selection
#' (Beinrucker et. al. 2016); see their paper for some of the benefits of
#' dropping features (besides increasing computational speed and decreasing
#' memory requirements). For sampling_type="SS", the features dropped in
#' each complementary pair of subsamples are identical in order to ensure that
#' the theoretical guarantees of Faletto and Bien (2022) are retained within
#' each individual pair of subsamples. (Note that this feature is not
#' investigated either theoretically or in simulations by Faletto and Bien
#' 2022). Must be between 0 and 1. Default is 0.
#' @param train_inds Optional; an integer or numeric vector containing the
#' indices of observations in X and y to set aside for model training by the
#' function getCssPreds after feature selection. (This will only work if y is
#' real-valued, because getCssPreds using ordinary least squares regression to
#' generate predictions.) If train_inds is not provided, all of the observations
#' in the provided data set will be used for feature selection.
#' @param num_cores Optional; an integer. If using parallel processing, the
#' number of cores to use for parallel processing (num_cores will be supplied
#' internally as the mc.cores argument of parallel::mclapply).
#' @return A list containing the following items: \item{feat_sel_mat}{A B (or
#' `2*B` for sampling.method "SS") x p numeric (binary) matrix.
#' `feat_sel_mat[i, j] = 1` if feature j was selected by the base feature
#' selection method on subsample i, and 0 otherwise.} \item{clus_sel_mat}{A B
#' (or 2*B for SS sampling) x length(clusters) numeric (binary) matrix.
#' `clus_sel_mat[i, j] = 1` if at least one feature from cluster j was selected
#' by the base feature selection method on subsample i, and 0 otherwise.}
#' \item{X}{The X matrix provided to css, coerced from a data.frame to a matrix
#' if needed.} \item{y}{The y vector provided to css.} \item{clusters}{A named
#' list of integer vectors containing all of the clusters provided to css, as
#' well as size 1 clusters of any features not listed in any of the clusters
#' provided to css. All clusters will have names; any clusters not provided with
#' a name in the input to css will be given names automatically by css (of the
#' form c1, etc.).} \item{train_inds}{Identical to the train_inds provided to
#' css.}

Tests for css and the other functions in this section are located at the end of this document. Next, we'll build the individual functions one at a time. (The one function above that I didn't mention at all is checkCssInputs, which confirms that the inputs to css are as expected and does some basic formatting on the inputs. To streamline presentation, this and other helper functions are specified later.) First we specify createSubsamples.

```{r}
#' Creates lists of subsamples for stability selection.
#'
#' @param n Integer or numeric; sample size of the data set.
#' @param p Integer or numeric; number of features.
#' @param B Integer or numeric; the number of subsamples. Note: For
#' sampling.type=="MB" the number of lasso fits will be `B`; for
#' sampling_type="SS" the number of lasso fits will be `2*B`.
#' @param sampling_type A character vector (either "SS" or "MB"); the sampling
#' type used for stability selection.
#' @param num_feats_remove Integer; number of features select automatically on
#' every iteration. Determined earlier from input prop_feats_remove to css.
#' @return A list of length `B` (or `2*B` for sampling_type = "SS"). If
#' prop_feats_remove = 0, each list element is an integer vector of length
#' floor(`n/2`) containing the indices of a subsample of 1:`n`. (For
#' sampling_type=="SS", the last `B` subsamples will be complementary pairs of
#' the first `B` subsamples; see Faletto and Bien 2022 or Shah and Samworth 2013
#' for details.) If prop_feats_remove > 0, each element is a named list with
#' members "subsample" (same as above) and "feats_to_keep", a logical vector
#' of length p; feats_to_keep[j] = TRUE if feature j is chosen for this
#' subsample, and false otherwise.

Again, getSelMatrix uses some helper functions to check the inputs for safety. getSelMatrix leverages the function mclapply from the parallel package, in order to allow for parallel processing if the user has set this up. This requires a helper function cssLoop, which is also specified in the later section for helper functions. 

getSelMatrix also uses a feature selection function fitfun as an input. fitfun can be provided by the user as an input to css. We provide one default fitfun, cssLasso, which works on a real-valued response y given a specified penalty parameter lambda > 0. Both for its own importance and to show an example of a valid fitfun, we show cssLasso here.

```{r}
#' Provided fitfun implementing the lasso
#'
#' Function used to select features with the lasso on each subsample in cluster
#' stability selection. Uses glmnet implementation of the lasso.
#' @param X A design matrix containing the predictors. (In practice this will
#' be a subsample of the full design matrix provided to css.)
#' @param y A numeric vector containing the response.
#' @param lambda Numeric; a nonnegative number for the lasso penalty to use
#' on each subsample. (For now, only one lambda value can be provided to
#' cssLasso; in the future, we plan to allow for multiple lambda values to be
#' provided to cssLasso, as described in Faletto and Bien 2022.)
#' @return An integer vector; the indices of the features selected by the lasso.

    checkCssLassoInputs(X, y, lambda)

    n <- nrow(X)
    p <- ncol(X)

    # Fit a lasso path (full path for speed, per glmnet documentation)

    lasso_model <- glmnet::glmnet(X, y, family="gaussian")
    stopifnot(all.equal(class(lasso_model), c("elnet", "glmnet")))

    # Get coefficients at desired lambda

    pred <- glmnet::predict.glmnet(lasso_model, type="nonzero",
        s=lambda, exact=TRUE, newx=X, x=X, y=y)

    if(is.null(pred[[1]])){return(integer())}

    stopifnot(is.data.frame(pred))
    stopifnot(!("try-error" %in% class(pred) | "error" %in% class(pred) |

    if(length(dim(pred)) == 2){
        selected_glmnet <- pred[, 1]
    } else if(length(dim(pred)) == 3){
        selected_glmnet <- pred[, 1, 1]
    } else if(length(dim(pred)) == 1){

    selected_glmnet <- as.integer(selected_glmnet)

    selected <- sort(selected_glmnet)

    return(selected)
}
```

Notice that cssLasso depends on the package glmnet, and calls the function checkCssLassoInputs, which verifies that the inputs to cssLasso are as needed. (In particular, the function css imposes very few requirements on lambda and y to allow the end user flexibility for any specified fitfun. checkCssLassoInputs ensures that y is a real-valued response, lambda is a nonnegative real number, etc.) checkCssLassoInputs is specified in the helper functions section later.

Finally, getClusterSelMatrix is the last significant function called within css.

```{r}
#' Get cluster selection matrix
#'
#' Given a matrix of feature selection indicator variables and a list of
#' clusters of features, returns a matrix of cluster indicator variables.
#'
#' @param clusters A named list where each entry is an integer vector of indices
#' of features that are in a common cluster, as in the output of formatClusters.
#' (The length of list clusters is equal to the number of clusters.) All
#' identified clusters must be non-overlapping, and all features must appear in
#' exactly one cluster (any unclustered features should be in their own
#' "cluster" of size 1).
#' @param res A binary integer matrix. es[i, j] = 1 if feature j was selected
#' on subsample i and equals 0 otherwise, as in the output of getSelMatrix.
#' (That is, each row is a selected set.)
#' @return A binary integer matrix with the same number of rows
#' as res and length(clusters) columns. Entry i, j is 1 if at least
#' one member of cluster j was selected on subsample i, and 0 otherwise.
#' @author Gregory Faletto, Jacob Bien
getClusterSelMatrix <- function(clusters, res){

    # Check input
    checkGetClusterSelMatrixInput(clusters, res)

    p <- ncol(res)

    n_clusters <- length(clusters)

    # Matrix of cluster selection proportions (with n_clusters columns)
    res_n_clusters <- matrix(rep(0L, nrow(res)*n_clusters), nrow=nrow(res),
        ncol=n_clusters)
    colnames(res_n_clusters) <- names(clusters)

    for(j in 1:n_clusters){
        # Identify rows of res where at least one feature from this cluster
        # was selected
        rows_j_sel <- apply(res, 1, function(x){any(x[clusters[[j]]] == 1)})

        # Put ones in these rows of res_n_clusters[, j]
        res_n_clusters[rows_j_sel, j] <- 1L

        if(length(clusters[[j]]) <= 1){
            next
        }
    }

    # Check output
    stopifnot(is.matrix(res_n_clusters))
    stopifnot(identical(colnames(res_n_clusters), names(clusters)))
    stopifnot(all(res_n_clusters %in% c(0, 1)))
    stopifnot(ncol(res_n_clusters) == length(clusters))

    return(res_n_clusters)
}
```

The helper function checkGetClusterSelMatrixInput verifies the inputs to getClusterSelMatrix.

With the above and the helper functions below, the css function is complete!

# Helper Functions

Below, we specify some of the helper functions for css, which are less important for understanding what css does.

* The function checkCssInputs is called at the beginning of the css function. It confirms that the inputs to css are as expected. Also, css allows some flexibility in how the inputs are formatted, and checkCssInputs converts the inputs into consistent formats for later use.
  - The function checkCssClustersInput is called within checkCssInputs, and specifically checks the clusters input.
  - formatClusters modifies clusters, ensuring every feature appears in exactly one cluster (any unclustered features are put in a "cluster" by themselves).
    * checkFormatClustersInput verifies the input to formatClusters for safety (this might seem a little redundant here, but formatClusters is also called by different functions in this package).
      - checkY ensures (here and elsewhere) that the provided y is as expected. (In particular, in general the inputted y can be a vector of any type as long as the specified fitfun can handle y appropriately. For some function inputs, y must be a numeric vector. checkY enforces this, among other things.)
    * checkClusters verifies that the output of formatClusters is as expected.
    * getPrototypes identifies the prototypes of each cluster--the feature within each cluster that has the largest marginal sample correlation with y.
      - identifyPrototype is the workhorse of getPrototypes, identifyng the prototype given a single cluster.
        * corFunction is a helper function called within identifyPrototype to calculate the aboslute value of the correlation between two vectors.
  - checkSamplingType ensures that the input sampling_type is as expected. 
  - checkB ensures that the input B is as expected.
  - checkPropFeatsRemove ensures that the input prop_feats_remove is as expected.
* The function cssLoop is called within css. In particular, it is a helper function needed in order to allow for parallel processing of the feature selection method on each of the subsamples.
  - checkCssLoopOutput verifies that the output of cssLoop as expected. This is particularly important because the user can specify their own feature selection method; checkCssLoopOutput verifies that the output of the feature selection method is valid, and provides an informative error message if not.
* checkCssLassoInputs checks that the inputs to the provided fitfun, cssLasso, are as needed.
* checkGetClusterSelMatrixInput verifies that the input to getClusterSelMatrix is as expected.

Tests are written for all of these functions and appear as early as possible after the function is defined. (For functions that don't depend on any other functions, tests appear immediately after the function; for functions with dependencies, the tests appear after all dependencies have been defined.)
      
checkCssInputs:

```{r}
#' Helper function to confirm that inputs to the function css are as expected,
#' and modify inputs if needed
#'
#' @param X An n x p numeric matrix (preferably) or a data.frame (which will
#' be coerced internally to a matrix by the function model.matrix) containing
#' p >= 2 features/predictors.
#' @param y The response; can be anything that takes the form of an
#' n-dimensional vector, with the ith entry corresponding to the ith row of X.
#' Typically (and for default fitfun = cssLasso), y should be an n-dimensional
#' numeric vector.
#' @param lambda A tuning parameter or set of tuning parameters that may be used
#' by the feature selection method fitfun. In the default case when
#' fitfun = cssLasso, lambda should be a numeric: the penalty to use for each
#' lasso fit. (css does not require lambda to be any particular object because
#' for a user-specified feature selection method fitfun, lambda can be an
#' arbitrary object. See the description of fitfun below.)
#' @param clusters A list of integer vectors; each vector should contain the 
#' indices of a cluster of features (a subset of 1:p). (If there is only one
#' cluster, clusters can either be a list of length 1 or an integer vector.)
#' All of the provided clusters must be non-overlapping. Every feature not
#' appearing in any cluster will be assumed to be unclustered (that is, they
#' will be treated as if they are in a "cluster" containing only themselves). If
#' clusters is a list of length 0 (or a list only containing clusters of length
#' 1), then css() returns the same results as stability selection (so the
#' returned feat_sel_mat will be identical to clus_sel_mat). Names for the
#' clusters will be needed later; any clusters that are not given names in the
#' provided list will be given names automatically by css. Default is list() (so
#' no clusters are specified).
#' @param fitfun A function; the feature selection function used on each
#' subsample by cluster stability selection. This can be any feature selection
#' method; the only requirement is that it accepts the arguments (and only the
#' arguments) X, y, and lambda and returns an integer vector that is a subset of
#' 1:p. For example, fitfun could be best subset selection or forward stepwise
#' selection or LARS and lambda could be the desired model size; or fitfun could be the
#' elastic net and lambda could be a length-two vector specifying lambda and
#' alpha. Default is cssLasso, an implementation of lasso (relying on the R
#' package glmnet), where lambda must be a positive numeric specifying the L1
#' penalty for the lasso.
#' @param sampling_type A character vector; either "SS" or "MB". For "MB",
#' all B subsamples are drawn randomly (as proposed by Meinshausen and Bühlmann
#' 2010). For "SS", in addition to these B subsamples, the B complementary pair
#' subsamples will be drawn as well (see Faletto and Bien 2022 or Shah and
#' Samworth 2013 for details). Default is "SS", and "MB" is not supported yet.
#' @param B Integer or numeric; the number of subsamples. Note: For
#' sampling.type=="MB" the total number of subsamples will be `B`; for
#' sampling_type="SS" the number of subsamples will be `2*B`. Default is 100
#' for sampling_type="MB" and 50 for sampling_type="SS".
#' @param prop_feats_remove Numeric; if prop_feats_remove is greater than 0,
#' then on each subsample, each feature is randomly dropped from the design
#' matrix that is provided to fitfun with probability prop_feats_remove
#' (independently across features). That is, in a typical subsample,
#' prop_feats_remove*p features will be dropped (though this number will vary).
#' This is similar in spirit (but distinct from) extended stability selection
#' (Beinrucker et. al. 2016); see their paper for some of the benefits of
#' dropping features (besides increasing computational speed and decreasing
#' memory requirements). For sampling_type="SS", the features dropped in
#' each complementary pair of subsamples are identical in order to ensure that
#' the theoretical guarantees of Faletto and Bien (2022) are retained within
#' each individual pair of subsamples. (Note that this feature is not
#' investigated either theoretically or in simulations by Faletto and Bien
#' 2022). Must be between 0 and 1. Default is 0.
#' @param train_inds Optional; an integer or numeric vector containing the
#' indices of observations in X and y to set aside for model training by the
#' function getCssPreds after feature selection. (This will only work if y is
#' real-valued, because getCssPreds using ordinary least squares regression to
#' generate predictions.) If train_inds is not provided, all of the observations
#' in the provided data set will be used for feature selection.
#' @param num_cores Optional; an integer. If using parallel processing, the
#' number of cores to use for parallel processing (num_cores will be supplied
#' internally as the mc.cores argument of parallel::mclapply).
#' @return A named list with the following elements: \item{feat_names}{A 
#' character vector containing the column names of X (if the provided X
#' had column names). If the provided X did not have column names, feat_names
#' will be NA.}\item{clusters}{A list of integer vectors; each vector will
#' contain the indices of a cluster of features. Any duplicated clusters
#' provided in the input will be removed.}

```{r}
#' Formats clusters in standardized way, optionally estimating cluster
#' prototypes
#'
#' @param clusters Either an integer vector of a list of integer vectors; each
#' vector should contain the indices of a cluster of features. (If there is only
#' one cluster, clusters can either be a list of length 1 or simply an integer
#' vector.) If clusters is specified then R is ignored.
#' @param p integer or numeric; the numbe of features in x (should match 
#' ncol(x), if x is provided)
#' @param clust_names A character vector of the names of the clusters in
#' clusters.
#' @param get_prototypes Logical: if TRUE, will identify prototype from each
#' cluster (the feature from each cluster that is most correlated with the
#' response) for the protolasso. In this case, x and y must be provided.
#' @param x n x p numeric matrix; design matrix. Only needs to be provided if
#' get_prototypes is TRUE.
#' @param y Numeric response vector; only needs to be provided if get_prototypes
#' is TRUE. Note: in general, the css function does not require y to be a
#' numeric vector, because the provided fitfun could use a different form of y
#' (for example, a categorical response variable). However, y must be numeric in
#' order to provide prototypes because the prototypes are determined using the
#' correlation between cluster members (columns of x) and y.
#' @param R Numeric p x p matrix; not currently used. Entry ij contains the 
#' "substitutive value" of feature i for feature j (diagonal must consist of
#' ones, all entries must be between 0 and 1, and matrix must be symmetric)
#' @return A named list with the following elements: \item{clusters}{A named
#' list where each entry is an integer vector of indices of features that are in
#' a common cluster. (The length of list clusters is equal to the number of
#' clusters.) All identified clusters are non-overlapping. All features appear
#' in exactly one cluster (any unclustered features will be put in their own
#' "cluster" of size 1).} \item{multiple}{Logical; TRUE if there is more than
#' one cluster of size greater than 1, FALSE otherwise.} \item{prototypes}{only
#' returned if get_prototypes=TRUE. An integer vector whose length is equal to
#' the number of clusters. Entry i is the index of the feature belonging to
#' cluster i that is most highly correlated with y (that is, the prototype for
#' the cluster, as in the protolasso; see Reid and Tibshirani 2016).}

#' Helper function run on each subsample

#' @param input Could be one of two things: \item{subsample}{An integer vector
#' of size `n/2` containing the indices of the observations in the subsample.}
#' \item{drop_var_input}{A named list containing two elements: one named
#' "subsample" and the same as the previous description, and a logical vector
#' named "feats_to_keep" containing the indices of the features to be
#' automatically selected.} (The first object is the output of the function
#' createSubsamples when the provided prop_feats_remove is 0, the default, and
#' the second object is the output of createSubsamples when prop_feats_remove >
#' 0.)
#' @param x an n x p numeric matrix containing the predictors. (This should be
#' the full design matrix provided to css.)
#' @param y A response; can be any response that takes the form of a length n
#' vector and is used (or not used) by fitfun. Typically (and for default fitfun
#' = cssLasso), y should be an n-dimensional numeric vector containing the
#' response. This should be the full response provided to css.
#' @param lambda A tuning parameter or set of tuning parameters that may be used
#' by the feature selection method. For example, in the default case when
#' fitfun = cssLasso, lambda is a numeric: the penalty to use for each lasso
#' fit.
#' @param fitfun A function that takes in arguments X, y, and lambda and returns
#' a vector of indices of the columns of X (selected features).
#' @return An integer vector; the indices of the features selected by fitfun.

### Selection and Prediction Functions

Now that css has been defined and tested, we write functions to work with the output of css. The output of these functions will be of more direct interest for most end users than the output of css. These functions are defined separately from css because the most computationally intensive steps happen within css. css can be called only once on a data set, and then the functions that follow can be explored relatively quickly (one can try different parameters, etc.).

* getCssSelections takes in the results of css along with user-defined parameters on how to select clusters (a mininmum or maximum number of clusters to select, along with a cutoff for cluster selection proportions) and selects clusters as well as features from those clusters.
* getCssDesign takes in the same inputs as getCssSelections along with an unlabeled test matrix of features X (containing the same features as the X matrix provided originally to css). It uses the results from css to select clusters like getCssSelections, then it uses a user-selected weighting scheme to compute weighted averages of the cluster members. It returns a test matrix of cluster representatives, which can be used for downstream predictive tasks.
* Finally, getCssPreds has the same inputs as getCssPreds *FIX THIS TYPO*, except it also accepts a set of labeled training data (where the response must be real-valued). getCssPreds selects clusters, forms matrices of cluster representatives on the training and test data, uses the training matrix of cluster representatives (along with the vector of responses for the training data) to estimate a linear model via ordinary least squares, and finally generates predictions on the test data using this linear model.

As in the previous section, we first define each function and then define the helper functions called by that function. Tests are written for each function as soon as all of its dependencies have been defined.

* getCssSelections
  - Calls checkCutoff, which checks that the specified cutoff input is as expected
  - checkWeighting verifies the weighting input to getCssSelections
  - checkMinNumClusts confirms that the min_num_clusts parameter provided to getCssSelections is as expected
  - Likewise for checkMaxNumClusts
  - getSelectedClusters is the workhorse function of getCssSelections, doing most of the work to get the selected clusters (and the selected features from those clusters) with the verified inputs
    * checkSelectedClusters checks internally that the selected clusters are as expected
    * getAllClustWeights gets the weights for each of the members of the selected clusters
      - getClustWeights gets the weights for a single cluster
    * checkGetSelectedClustersOutput verifies the output of getSelectedClusters
* getCssDesign
  - checkNewXProvided confirms that the design matrix provided to getCssDesign matches the characteristics of the matrix that was provided to css. 
    * checkXInputResults also verifies these inputs (and is also used by getCssPreds on both the training and test data)
  - formCssDesign is the workhorse function, generating a matrix of cluster representatives with the verified inputs to getCssDesign
    * checkFormCssDesignInputs verifies the inputs to formCssDesign (somewhat redundantly here, but formCssDesign is called by more than one function, so this verifies the inputs to formCssDesign regardless of where it is called).
* getCssPreds
  - checkGetCssPredsInputs verifies the inputs to getCssPreds

#' Obtain a selected set of clusters and features

#' Generate sets of selected clusters and features from cluster stability
#' selection.
#' @param css_results An object of class "cssr" (the output of the function

#' @param weighting Character; determines how to calculate the weights for
#' individual features within the selected clusters. Only those features with
#' nonzero weight within the selected clusters will be returned. Must be one of
#' "sparse", "weighted_avg", or "simple_avg'. For "sparse", all the weight is
#' put on the most frequently
#' selected individual cluster member (or divided equally among all the clusters
#' that are tied for the top selection proportion if there is a tie). For

#' "simple_avg", each cluster member gets equal weight regardless of the
#' individual feature selection proportions (that is, all cluster members within
#' each selected cluster will be returned.). See Faletto and Bien (2022) for
#' details. Default is "sparse".
#' @param cutoff Numeric; getCssSelections will select and return only of those
#' clusters with selection proportions equal to at least cutoff. Must be between
#' 0 and 1. Default is 0 (in which case either all clusters are selected, or
#' max_num_clusts are selected, if max_num_clusts is specified).
#' @param min_num_clusts Integer or numeric; the minimum number of clusters to
#' use regardless of cutoff. (That is, if the chosen cutoff returns fewer than
#' min_num_clusts clusters, the cutoff will be increased until at least
#' min_num_clusts clusters are selected.) Default is 1.
#' @param max_num_clusts Integer or numeric; the maximum number of clusters to
#' use regardless of cutoff. (That is, if the chosen cutoff returns more than
#' max_num_clusts clusters, the cutoff will be decreased until at most
#' max_num_clusts clusters are selected.) Default is NA (in which case

getCssDesign

```{r}
#' Obtain a design matrix of cluster representatives
#'
#' Takes a matrix of observations from the original feature space and returns
#' a matrix of representatives from the selected clusters based on the results
#' of cluster stability selection.
#' @param css_results An object of class "cssr" (the output of the function
#' css).
#' @param newX A numeric matrix (preferably) or a data.frame (which will
#' be coerced internally to a matrix by the function model.matrix) containing
#' the data that will be used to generate the design matrix of cluster
#' representatives. Must contain the same features (in the same
#' number of columns) as the X matrix provided to css, and if the columns of
#' newX are labeled, the names must match the variable names provided to css.
#' newX may be omitted if train_inds were provided to css to set aside
#' observations for model estimation. If this is the case, then when newX is
#' omitted getCssDesign will return a design matrix of cluster representatives
#' formed from the train_inds observations from the matrix X provided to css.
#' (If no train_inds were provided to css, newX must be provided to
#' getCssDesign.) Default is NA.
#' @param weighting Character; determines how to calculate the weights to
#' combine features from the selected clusters into weighted averages, called
#' cluster representatives. Must be one of "sparse", "weighted_avg", or
#' "simple_avg'. For "sparse", all the weight is put on the most frequently
#' selected individual cluster member (or divided equally among all the clusters
#' that are tied for the top selection proportion if there is a tie). For
#' "weighted_avg", the weight used for each cluster member is calculated in
#' proportion to the individual selection proportions of each feature. For
#' "simple_avg", each cluster member gets equal weight regardless of the
#' individual feature selection proportions (that is, the cluster representative
#' is just a simple average of all the cluster members). See Faletto and Bien
#' (2022) for details. Default is "weighted_avg".
#' @param cutoff Numeric; getCssDesign will only include those clusters with
#' selection proportions equal to at least cutoff. Must be between 0 and 1.
#' Default is 0 (in which case either all clusters are used, or max_num_clusts
#' are used, if max_num_clusts is specified).
#' @param min_num_clusts Integer or numeric; the minimum number of clusters to
#' use regardless of cutoff. (That is, if the chosen cutoff returns fewer than
#' min_num_clusts clusters, the cutoff will be increased until at least
#' min_num_clusts clusters are selected.) Default is 1.
#' @param max_num_clusts Integer or numeric; the maximum number of clusters to
#' use regardless of cutoff. (That is, if the chosen cutoff returns more than
#' max_num_clusts clusters, the cutoff will be decreased until at most
#' max_num_clusts clusters are selected.) Default is NA (in which case
#' max_num_clusts is ignored).
#' @return A design matrix with either nrow(newX) (or length(train_inds), if
#' train_inds was provided to css and newX was not provided to getCssDesign)
#' observations and number of columns equal to the number of selected clusters,
#' containing the cluster representatives for each cluster.

## Documenting the package and building

We finish by running commands that will document, build, and install the package.  It may also be a good idea to check the package from within this file.

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
litr::document() # <-- use instead of devtools::document()
# devtools::build()
# devtools::install()
# devtools::check(document = FALSE)
```

## Add README

```{r}
litr::add_readme("../source-files/README.Rmd")
```
