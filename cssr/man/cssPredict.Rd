\title{Wrapper function to generate predictions from cluster stability selected
model in one step}
\usage{
cssPredict(
  X_train_selec,
  y_train_selec,
  X_test,
  clusters = list(),
  lambda = NA,
  cutoff = NA,
  max_num_clusts = NA,
  train_inds = NA,
  auto_select_size = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{X_train_selec}{An n x p numeric matrix (preferably) or a data.frame
(which will be coerced internally to a matrix by the function model.matrix)
containing the p >= 2 features/predictors. The data from X_train_selec and
y_train_selec will be split into two parts; half of the data will be used for
feature selection by cluster stability selection, and half will be used for
estimating a linear model on the selected cluster representatives.}

\item{y_train_selec}{A length-n numeric vector containing the responses;
\code{y[i]} is the response corresponding to observation \code{X[i, ]}. Unlke the more
general setup of css, y_train_selec must be real-valued because predictions
will be generated by ordinary least squares.}

\item{X_test}{A numeric matrix (preferably) or a data.frame (which will
be coerced internally to a matrix by the function model.matrix) containing
the data that will be used to generate predictions. Must contain the same
features (in the same number of columns) as X_train_selec, and if the columns
of X_test are named, they must match the names of X_train_selec.}

\item{clusters}{Optional; either an integer vector of a list of integer
vectors; each vector should contain the indices of a cluster of features (a
subset of 1:p). (If there is only one cluster, clusters can either be a list
of length 1 or an integer vector.) All of the provided clusters must be
non-overlapping. Every feature not appearing in any cluster will be assumed
to be unclustered (that is, they  will be treated as if they are in a
"cluster" containing only themselves). If clusters is a list of length 0 (or
a list only containing clusters of length 1), then css() returns the same
results as stability selection (so feat_sel_mat will be identical to
clus_sel_mat). Names for the clusters will be needed later; any clusters that
are not given names in the list clusters will be given names automatically by
css. CAUTION: if the provided X is a data.frame that contains a categorical
feature with more than two levels, then the resulting matrix made from
model.matrix will have a different number of columns than the provided
data.frame, some of the feature numbers will change, and the clusters
argument will not work properly (in the current version of the package). To
get correct results in this case, please use model.matrix to convert the
data.frame to a numeric matrix on your own, then provide this matrix and
cluster assignments with respect to this matrix.Default is list() (so no
clusters are specified, and every feature is assumed to be in a "cluster"
containing only itself).}

\item{lambda}{Optional; the tuning parameter to be used by the lasso for
feature selection in each subsample. If lambda is not provided, cssPredict
will choose one automatically by cross-validation. Default is NA.}

\item{cutoff}{Numeric; getCssPreds will make use only of those clusters with
selection proportions equal to at least cutoff. Must be between 0 and 1.
Default is 0 (in which case either all clusters are used, or max_num_clusts
are used, if max_num_clusts is specified).}

\item{max_num_clusts}{Integer or numeric; the maximum number of clusters to
use regardless of cutoff. (That is, if the chosen cutoff returns more than
max_num_clusts clusters, the cutoff will be decreased until at most
max_num_clusts clusters are selected.) Default is NA (in which case
max_num_clusts is ignored).}

\item{train_inds}{Optional; an integer or numeric vector containing the
indices of observations in X and y to set aside for model training after
feature selection. If train_inds is not provided, half of the data will be
used for feature selection and half for model estimation (chosen at random).}

\item{auto_select_size}{Logical; if TRUE, then max_num_clusts will be
automatically estimated using the lasso with cross-validation. Default is
TRUE, though his argument is ignored if either cutoff or max_num_clusts is
provided. (If desired output is to generate predictions using all clusters,
you should set auto_select_size to FALSE and do not provide cutoff or
max_num_clusts.)}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length nrow(X_test) of predictions
corresponding to the observations from X_test.
}
\description{
Select clusters using cluster stability selection, form cluster
representatives, fit a linear model, and generate predictions from a matrix
of unlabeled data. This is a wrapper function for css and getCssPreds. Using
cssPredict is simpler, but it has fewer options, and it executes the full
(computationally expensive) subsampling procedured every time it is called.
In contrast, css can be called just once, and then cssPredict can quickly
return results for different matrices of new data or using different values
of cutoff, max_num_clusts, etc. by using the calculations done in one call to
css.
