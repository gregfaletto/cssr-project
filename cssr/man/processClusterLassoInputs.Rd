\usage{
processClusterLassoInputs(X, y, clusters, nlambda)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{An n x p numeric matrix (preferably) or a data.frame (which will
be coerced internally to a matrix by the function model.matrix) containing
p >= 2 features/predictors}

\item{y}{The response; A length n numeric (or integer) real-valued vector.}

\item{clusters}{A list of integer vectors; each vector should contain the
indices of a cluster of features (a subset of 1:p). (If there is only one
cluster, clusters can either be a list of length 1 or an integer vector.)
All of the provided clusters must be non-overlapping. Every feature not
appearing in any cluster will be assumed to be unclustered (that is, they
will be treated as if they are in a "cluster" containing only themselves).
Default is list() (so no clusters are specified).}

\item{nlambda}{Integer; the number of lambda values to use in the lasso fit
for the protolasso. Default is 100 (following the default for glmnet). For
now, nlambda must be at least 2 (using a single lambda is not supported).}
}
\value{
A list with four elements. \item{x}{The provided X, converted to a
matrix if it was provided as a data.frame, and with column names removed.}
\item{clusters}{A named list where each entry is an integer vector of indices
of features that are in a common cluster. (The length of list clusters is
equal to the number of clusters.) All identified clusters are
non-overlapping. All features appear in exactly one cluster (any unclustered
features will be put in their own "cluster" of size 1).}
\item{prototypes}{An integer vector whose length is equal to the number of
clusters. Entry i is the index of the feature belonging to cluster i that is
most highly correlated with y (that is, the prototype for the cluster, as in
the protolasso; see Reid and Tibshirani 2016).} \item{var_names}{If the
provided X matrix had column names, the names of the featurrs in the provided
X matrix. If no names were provided, feat_names will be NA.}
