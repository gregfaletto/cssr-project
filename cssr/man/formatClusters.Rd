prototypes}
\usage{
formatClusters(
  clusters = NA,
  p = -1,
  clust_names = NA,
  get_prototypes = FALSE,
  x = NA,
  y = NA,
  R = NA
)
}
\arguments{
\item{clusters}{Either an integer vector of a list of integer vectors; each
vector should contain the indices of a cluster of features. (If there is only
one cluster, clusters can either be a list of length 1 or simply an integer
vector.) If clusters is specified then R is ignored.}

\item{p}{integer or numeric; the numbe of features in x (should match
ncol(x), if x is provided)}

\item{clust_names}{A character vector of the names of the clusters in
clusters.}

\item{get_prototypes}{Logical: if TRUE, will identify prototype from each
cluster (the feature from each cluster that is most correlated with the
response) for the protolasso. In this case, x and y must be provided.}

\item{x}{n x p numeric matrix; design matrix. Only needs to be provided if
get_prototypes is TRUE.}

\item{y}{Numeric response vector; only needs to be provided if get_prototypes
is TRUE. Note: in general, the css function does not require y to be a
numeric vector, because the provided fitfun could use a different form of y
(for example, a categorical response variable). However, y must be numeric in
order to provide prototypes because the prototypes are determined using the
correlation between cluster members (columns of x) and y.}

\item{R}{Numeric p x p matrix; not currently used. Entry ij contains the
"substitutive value" of feature i for feature j (diagonal must consist of
ones, all entries must be between 0 and 1, and matrix must be symmetric)}
}
\value{
A named list with the following elements: \item{clusters}{A named
list where each entry is an integer vector of indices of features that are in
a common cluster. (The length of list clusters is equal to the number of
clusters.) All identified clusters are non-overlapping. All features appear
in exactly one cluster (any unclustered features will be put in their own
"cluster" of size 1).} \item{multiple}{Logical; TRUE if there is more than
one cluster of size greater than 1, FALSE otherwise.} \item{prototypes}{only
returned if get_prototypes=TRUE. An integer vector whose length is equal to
the number of clusters. Entry i is the index of the feature belonging to
cluster i that is most highly correlated with y (that is, the prototype for
the cluster, as in the protolasso; see Reid and Tibshirani 2016).}
