\title{Get variance of noise to add to Z in order to yield proxies X with desired
correlations with Z}
\usage{
getNoiseVar(cor)
}
\arguments{
\item{cor}{A numeric vector of desired correlations for each proxy to have
with Z. Note: correlations must be positive.}
}
\value{
A vector of variances of independent Gaussian random variables to add
to Z in order to yield proxies with the desired correlations with Z.
