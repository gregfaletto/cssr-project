\title{Obtain a selected set of clusters and features}
\usage{
getCssSelections(
  css_results,
  weighting = "sparse",
  cutoff = 0,
  min_num_clusts = 1,
  max_num_clusts = NA
)
}
\arguments{
\item{css_results}{An object of class "cssr" (the output of the function
css).}

\item{weighting}{Character; determines how to calculate the weights for
individual features within the selected clusters. Only those features with
nonzero weight within the selected clusters will be returned. Must be one of
"sparse", "weighted_avg", or "simple_avg'. For "sparse", all the weight is
put on the most frequently
selected individual cluster member (or divided equally among all the clusters
that are tied for the top selection proportion if there is a tie). For
"weighted_avg", only the features within a selected cluster that were
themselves selected on at least one subsample will have nonzero weight. For
"simple_avg", each cluster member gets equal weight regardless of the
individual feature selection proportions (that is, all cluster members within
each selected cluster will be returned.). See Faletto and Bien (2022) for
details. Default is "sparse".}

\item{cutoff}{Numeric; getCssSelections will select and return only of those
clusters with selection proportions equal to at least cutoff. Must be between
0 and 1. Default is 0 (in which case either all clusters are selected, or
max_num_clusts are selected, if max_num_clusts is specified).}

\item{min_num_clusts}{Integer or numeric; the minimum number of clusters to
use regardless of cutoff. (That is, if the chosen cutoff returns fewer than
min_num_clusts clusters, the cutoff will be increased until at least
min_num_clusts clusters are selected.) Default is 1.}

\item{max_num_clusts}{Integer or numeric; the maximum number of clusters to
use regardless of cutoff. (That is, if the chosen cutoff returns more than
max_num_clusts clusters, the cutoff will be decreased until at most
max_num_clusts clusters are selected.) Default is NA (in which case
max_num_clusts is ignored).}
}
\value{
A named list with two items. \item{selected_clusts}{A named list of
integer vectors; each vector contains the indices of the features in one of
the selected clusters.} \item{selected_feats}{A named integer vector; the
indices of the features with nonzero weights from all of the selected
clusters.} \item{weights}{A named list of the same length as selected_clusts.
Each list element weights[\link{j}] is a numeric vector of the weights to use for
the jth selected cluster, and it has the same name as the cluster it
corresponds to.}
