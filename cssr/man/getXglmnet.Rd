\title{Converts the provided design matrix to an appropriate format for either the
protolasso or the cluster representative lasso.}
\usage{
getXglmnet(x, clusters, type, prototypes = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric matrix; the provided matrix with n observations and p
features.}

\item{clusters}{A named list where each entry is an integer vector of indices
of features that are in a common cluster. (The length of list clusters should
be equal to the number of clusters.) All identified clusters should be
non-overlapping. All features should appear in exactly one cluster (any
unclustered features should be put in their own "cluster" of size 1).}

\item{type}{Character; "protolasso" for the protolasso or "clusterRepLasso"
for the cluster representative lasso.}

\item{prototypes}{Only required for type "protolasso". An integer vector
whose length is equal to the number of clusters. Entry i should be the
prototype for cluster i (the feature belonging to cluster i that is most
highly correlated with y; see Reid and Tibshirani 2016).}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix; the design matrix as required for the protolasso or
cluster representative lasso, prepared for input to glmnet.
}
\description{
Creates design matrix for glmnet by dealing with clusters (for
type="protolasso", discards all cluster members except prototype; for
type="clusterRepLasso", replaces all cluster members with a simple
average of all the cluster members).
