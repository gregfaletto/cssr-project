#' Formats clusters in standardized way, optionally estimating cluster
#' prototypes
#'
#' @param clusters Either an integer vector of a list of integer vectors; each
#' vector should contain the indices of a cluster of features. (If there is only
#' one cluster, clusters can either be a list of length 1 or simply an integer
#' vector.) If clusters is specified then R is ignored.
#' @param p integer or numeric; the numbe of features in x (should match 
#' ncol(x), if x is provided)
#' @param clust_names A character vector of the names of the clusters in clusters.
#' @param get_prototypes Logical: if TRUE, will identify prototype from each
#' cluster (the feature from each cluster that is most correlated with the
#' response) for the protolasso. In this case, x and y must be provided.
#' @param x n x p numeric matrix; design matrix. Only needs to be provided if
#' get_prototypes is TRUE.
#' @param y Numeric response vector; only needs to be provided if get_prototypes
#' is TRUE. Note: in general, the css function does not require y to be a
#' numeric vector, because the provided fitfun could use a different form of y
#' (for example, a categorical response variable). However, y must be numeric in
#' order to provide prototypes because the prototypes are determined using the
#' correlation between cluster members (columns of x) and y.
#' @param R Numeric p x p matrix; not currently used. Entry ij contains the 
#' "substitutive value" of feature i for feature j (diagonal must consist of
#' ones, all entries must be between 0 and 1, and matrix must be symmetric)
#' @return A named list with the following elements: \item{clusters}{A named
#' list where each entry is an integer vector of indices of features that are in
#' a common cluster. (The length of list clusters is equal to the number of
#' clusters.) All identified clusters are non-overlapping. All features appear
#' in exactly one cluster (any unclustered features will be put in their own
#' "cluster" of size 1).} \item{multiple}{Logical; TRUE if there is more than
#' one cluster of size greater than 1, FALSE otherwise.} \item{prototypes}{only
#' returned if get_prototypes=TRUE. An integer vector whose length is equal to
#' the number of clusters. Entry i is the index of the feature belonging to
#' cluster i that is most highly correlated with y (that is, the prototype for
#' the cluster, as in the protolasso; see Reid and Tibshirani 2016).}
